VERSION 1.6.2

- Add properties dialog (need xfconf at build-time)
  - Default configuration
  - New window configuration
- Display an optional arrow beneath the panel plugin button to show the menu
- Updated translations (ca, de, el, eu, fr, hu, nb_NO, nl, pt_BR, pt_PT)

VERSION 1.6.1

- Add file system monitoring.
  This is how it works:
    - Create a new window: mkdir ~/.local/share/notes/my-notes
    - Delete a window: rmdir ~/.local/share/notes/my-notes
                    or rm -rf ~/.local/share/notes/my-notes
    - Refresh the notes from a window: touch ~/.local/share/notes/my-notes
  You can't create new notes inside a window like this, because some editors
  creates/deletes many files on the fly.  The only solution here is to edit
  your notes, and then run the command `touch`.  But that's just some geeky
  code which will never be used, indeed I mostly enjoined to play with
  ThunarVfs.  The notes are reloaded if their data is modified.
- Update the README
- Bugfixes

VERSION 1.6.0

- Initial code rewrite for multiple window support and a better way
  to save the notes

- To migrate your notes from earlier version you can run this:
WINDOW_NAME="Notes (migrate)" && mkdir -p \
~/.local/share/notes/$WINDOW_NAME && grep '^note[0-9]*=' \
~/.config/xfce4/panel/notes.rc | cut -d= -f2- | split -l 1 -d - \
