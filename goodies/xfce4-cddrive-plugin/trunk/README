What is it?
===========

xfce4-cddrive-plugin puts a button in the XFCE panel which allow to open
or close a CD-ROM drive tray.
Additionally, the button icon reports the content of the drive.
The icon indicates if there is a disc in the drive, if it is mounted,
and the type of the disc (regular CD-ROM, audio or DVD).
You can also mount or unmount the disc via the plugin's menu (the action appears
when a disc is in the drive).


Dependencies
============

To build the plugin, the following packages are required:
- libxfcegui4 >= 4.3.99.2
- libxfce4panel >= 4.3.99.2
- exo >= 0.3.1.12rc2
- hal-storage >= 0.5.8.1
- dbus-glib >= 0.71
- libcdio >= 0.76

The plugin can query the freedb.org servers for audio CD infos (like title and
performer's name). To compile with this feature enabled, you need:
- libcddb >= 1.2.1
- gthread >= 2.12.4 (optional, prevent the plugin from hanging while waiting
                     for freedb.org response)


Limitations
===========

- This release only works correctly with Linux.

- This plugin is based on HAL, and will not work if 'hald' is not running.

- The icons used to reports the content of the drive are the one of the theme
  currently in use (it becomes a limitation if your theme does not provide icons
  for cdrom drive and disc).


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions. For more
