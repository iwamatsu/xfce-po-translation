See http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-places-plugin for more information.

This xfce4-places-plugin brings much of the functionality of GNOME's Places menu to Xfce.

The plugin adds a small button to the panel. Clicking on it opens a menu, which shows:
 1) System folders: home directory, trash, desktop, file system
 2) Removable media
 3) User-defined bookmarks
 4) Recent Documents (with gtk v2.10+)

vim: wrap linebreak
