xfce4-datetime-plugin v0.6.0 released

This is almost entirely a bug fix release. Thanks to Steve Tyler, especially,
for reporting over 15 bugs and submitting many patches.

One notable user interface change is that the panel button is now a
GtkToggleButton, so it will light up when you hover the mouse over it and
appear pushed in when you click on it.

There's a tooltips implementation in the works that unfortunately isn't ready
yet for this release - see Bug #4141 for details. I think this will be the
primary goal for next time.
