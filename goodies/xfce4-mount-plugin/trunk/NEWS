Version 0.5.4 now detects automatically mounted devices.
Note that for unmounting  them, you might need to setup 
special commands, like "pmount", or "sudo umount".

Also does it automatically map the rather long name
"/dev/mapper/logvol1/volume2" to "LVM 1:2". Currently,
you cannot disable this behavior, as its is more than 
strongly recommended. Upon thousands of requests, I
might consider adding another switch in the already 
rather big options dialog.
