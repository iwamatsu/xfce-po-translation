+ drop old gtk_tooltips
+ display mem < 0MB (we can't show in KB unless we rewrite the sort function
		which I think is not worth the effort)
+ support multi core (show cpu usage per process)
+ move get_cpu_usage() out from functions.c, it is an os-dependant function

+ *BSD support with the 'kvm' files
+ ability to switch to a tree-store
+ sending custom signals
+ tray-icon
