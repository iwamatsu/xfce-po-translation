What is it?
===========

This is a Smart plugin for the Xfce panel, version 4.4.0 or higher. It
checks for package updates using the Smart Package Manager (smartpm.org).

It should work with both Fedora (RPM packages) and Ubuntu (DEB packages),
and also with Slackware (TAR packages) although this has not been tested.

It can also be configured, though with less features and functionality,
to use either the Yum (+Extender) or APT (+Synaptic) package managers.

Alternatively you can try the Slapt package manager (slapt-get and gslapt)
for Slackware and Vector Linux, although these are highly experimental...

Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.

For more detailed information, visit the Smart plugin website at:
http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-smartpm-plugin

If compiling directly from the trunk, you need to run `./autogen.sh`
To make an RPM package, you can use "make rpm". For DEB, "make deb".

To make a Slackware TAR package, use one of the tgz/tbz/tlz targets.
(You will probably need to run that make command as the root user.)

Usage
=====

You can set the appearance and preferences, in the panel settings dialog.

Click the icon to launch the Smart install/upgrade GUI, or middle-click
the icon to check for upgrades. This will check using local cache only.

To update channels from the network, use the menu item or dialog button
(install the setuid program "smart-update" to avoid sudo and the dialog)

By default, the plugin will check for upgrades / updates on demand only.
Recommended is to use check interval for upgrades, and cron for updates.

Commands
========

The following table shows which Package Manager commands are being used:

      +-------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
P.M.  | CHECK FOR UPGRADES (local)          | UPDATE CHANNELS (network)        |
      |=====================================|==================================|
Smart | smart upgrade --dump                | smart-update                     |
      |-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
Yum   | yum -C check-update                 | su -c "yum check-update"         |
      |-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
APT   | apt-get --simulate dist-upgrade     | sudo apt-get update              |
      |-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
Slapt | slapt-get --simulate --dist-upgrade | su -c "slapt-get --update"       |
      +-------------------------------------+----------------------------------+

Checking for upgrades or browsing packages can be done as a regular user,
while updating channels or installing packages requires superuser privileges.

The panel plugin will look for a consolehelper program called "smart-root",
else try to use either "gksudo" or "gksu" to run the Smart package manager.

How to report bugs?
