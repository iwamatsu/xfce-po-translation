XFce4 Netload plugin
--------------------

 - A netload plugin for the Xfce4 desktop environment -- http://www.xfce4.org -

Following operating systems are supported:
 
 * Linux
 * FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
 * Sun Solaris
 * HP_UX
 * MacOS X

I have only Linux installed so I can test only on Linux. If you encounter any
problems on other operating systems (or on Linux, of course) feel free to send
me an e-mail. If you have a patch to fix it it would be better.

The code for the plugin is based on the sample-plugin from Benedikt Meurer and
on the xfce4-systemload-plugin from Riccardo Persichetti. The layout is the same
as the systemload-plugin. This made programming very easy and looks good, too.

The netload code is based on wormulon (a command-line util) from Hendrik Scholz.
You find this program at http://www.raisdorf.net/wormulon/.

I'm not planning making much improvements in the future so if you want to take
over developement, just drop me a note. I just programmed it because I needed it
but I plan to maintain it so that it's running with the most current stable
release of Xfce.

If you have translations for your language, please mail me. I'll include it in
the distribution!

And remember:

    Interoperability is the keyword, uniformity is a dead end.
