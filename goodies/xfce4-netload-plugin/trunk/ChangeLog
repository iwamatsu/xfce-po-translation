	* Changed all static variables to a structure which is given the function
	  as a parameter. This makes more than one instance of the plugin possible.
	* Released 0.2.0pre2 which is the next test version for 0.2.0.

2003-08-24 Bernhard Walle
	* Using the last four measures in history so it's easier to read.
	* Automatic maximum now really works.
	* Using kilobytes for displaying.
	* Using thousands separators of the current locale for so that it's
	  easier to read. Since this feature is not available on in printf()
	  according the ISO C99 standard I implemented this myself. This code
	  may contain bugs.
	* Dropped use of libgtop2 library. New code is based on Wormulon 
	  (http://www.raisdorf.net/wormulon/) the operating systems Linux,
	  FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Sun Solaris and HP_UX (Hewlett-Packard) are
	  directly  supported. *BSD without use of kvm.

	* Released 0.2.0pre1 which is a test version for 0.2.0.

	  FreeBSD code is still implemented without libgtop2 but this may change
	  in future.
	* Changed "bit/s" string to "byte/s" since the value *is* in byte/s. 
	  Translators may update their translated strings, for the German 
	  translation I did this already.
	* Changed license to GNU General Public License since linking to the 
	  libgtop2 library requires this. (libgtop2 is *not* LGPL)
	* See also i18n changes in po/ChangeLog
	* released 0.1.9 which is a test version for 0.2.0
