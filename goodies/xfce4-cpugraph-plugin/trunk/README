Currently supporting Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
The *BSD support is from Riccardo's <riccardo.persichetti@tin.it> system load plugin.

* "Use frame"? If this option is checked it draws a frame around the plugin.
* "Non-linear time scale"? When checked, scrolling will work differently.
  Try and see.
* The color next to the checkbox opens a color dialog so you set the frame(s) color.
