	* panel-plugin: Split code in several files, cleanup and 
	refactoring code. Remove timescaling, remove *BSD code, remove 
	fire color and frequency modes.
	Add bar graph for each cpu core.
	Add grid view mode
	Add associate command (default is xterm top)

2007-05-07 22:30 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, cpu.h, os.c, os.h: Added 'cpufreq' color
	mode, which ranges from color #1 to color #2 proportionally to CPU
	scaling frequency.  Added 'Non-linear time scale." as an on/off
	option.  Added scaling detection so new color mode can work, and
	tweaked Linux CPU usage code a little bit to account for new stats
	in kernel v2.6, also optimize resources.

2004-06-12 03:00 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c: Fixed bug where LED-mode was not being 
	drawn correctly. Removed some ugly code that wasn't used.

2004-06-11 07:15 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, panel-plugin/cpu.h: Added description
	of "Color *" in the REAMDE file. Even more changes to the 
	settings dialog.

2004-06-08 17:48 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, panel-plugin/cpu.h: 
	Version 0.2, even more changes to the settings dialog. Added
	None, Gradiant and Fire support to all modes which currently 
	are Normal, LED and No History. Some minor bug fixes etc.

2004-06-08 03:15 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, panel-plugin/cpu.h: You can now change
	the color of the frame too. Rewrote the drawing algorithms to
	match better with the frame. I also removed some useless code
	from the algorithms, so everything should work much smoother 
	now.

2004-06-08 01:45 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, panel-plugin/cpu.h: Reconstructed the
	settings dialog and added a option to draw a frame with the 
	graph.

2004-06-07 14:28 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c: Fixed bug where the plugin didn't
	center itself after panel resizing.

2004-06-07 03:30 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.c, panel-plugin/cpu.h, panel-plguin/os.c,
	panel-plugin/os.h, panel-plugin/Makefile.am, configure.ac:
	Version 0.1.1, removed some text from configure.ac that
	didn't belong there.
	Converted all C++ related code to plain C due to possible
	bugs with the panel. The drawing area should also be 
	doublebufferd now.

2004-06-07 01:50 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc, panel-plugin/cpu.h, panel-plugin/os.cc:
	UpdateCPU now returns true instead of nothing. Fixed bug where
	plugin couldn't	compile on *BSD systems. (Thanks benny)

2004-06-06 18:03 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Fixed bug in "normal mode".

2004-06-06 17:01 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc, panel-plugin/cpu.h: Forgot to update 
	some funtions after removing global variables.

2004-06-06 16:40 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc, panel-plugin/cpu.h: Removed global 
	variables and fixed bug where expose_event didn't work.
	Fixed alignment setting for the width spin-button.

2004-06-06 03:13 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Fixed bug where the width was set
	to 4 if you switched to vertical panel mode.

2004-06-06 02:59 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Much nicer solution when centering
	the plugin.
	Now the plugin is strictly following the icon_size 
	defined sizes. (Which imo every plugin should follow.)
	
2004-06-06 01:25 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Fixed bug where the plugin didn't
	resize itself upon reading width/height.

2004-06-03 19:01 phase

	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Fixed bug where the plugin could 
	get larger than icon_size when changing orientation.
	
2004-06-03 15:40 phase
	
	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Added support for vertical panel 
	aswell.

2004-06-02 17:50 phase
	
	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc, panel-plugin/os.cc, 
	panel-plugin/os.h: Added support for FreeBSD, NetBSD 
	and OpenBSD. (Code from Riccardo's systemload plugin.)

2004-06-02 13:22 phase
	
	* panel-plugin/cpu.cc: Reconstructing the Get-CPU-Usage 
	part for better support of other OS's.
