This is an Xfce panel plugin which allows you to control your V4l radio device.
You can turn your radio on/off, tune it to some frequency and manage station
presets.


MOUSE CONTROLS
--------------
To switch your radio on/off, simply left-click on the panel (by default it says
"- off -", if it's turned on it displays the current frequency).

Once turned on, the middle button will show you the station preset menu. This
is also the place to set the frequency you'd like to tune your radio to.

The mouse wheel allows you to change frequency or station preset. You can
choose your preferred behaviour in the properties dialog (right-click menu).
