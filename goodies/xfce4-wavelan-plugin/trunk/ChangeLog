	* Fix support for OpenBSD, using net80211 API instead of deprecated wi_* API.
	* Show link quality AND txpower in plugin tooltip.

	* Fix a bug where the interface that is top of the list isn't used unless
		something else is selected first. It now defaults to the first interface
		found if there is no rc file or interface stored in it. This does remove
		the ability to have an instance without an associated interface, but who
		wants that anyway? Thanks to Maximilian Schleiss for the report.

	* Add the headers added in the last change to the checks in configure.

2007-01-10 19:02  james

	* Include more kernel headers in wi_linux.c as newer kernels don't
	  do it for you when you are in userspace. Thanks to Maximilian Schleiss
		for help debugging.

2007-01-09 20:24  james

	* Add a check for libxfce4util in ./configure as it is possible to have
	  the panel headers without the util headers. I haven't used libs and 
		cflags which is probably a bug.

2007-01-09 00:04  james

	* Fix a bug in which the signal strength was incorrectly calculated, due to
	  a max value being assumed that is not correct and usually too small.
		This change will probably reduce the signal strength reported, but that is
		because it was incorrect before. Bug 1499.
	* Add config.h to panel-plugin/wi_linux.c to enable the trace debugging
	  properly.

2007-01-07 23:28  james

	* Remove an unused variable that caused a failure with -Werror.

2007-01-07 22:45  james

	* Fix an autoconf problem that needed sys/socket.h including before
	  linux/wireless.h in its test program.

2007-01-07 16:49  james

	* Add an option to make the panel icon square.

2006-12-21 22:23  james

	* Add a THANKS file for people who contribute to the plugin.

2006-12-21 21:34  james

	* Add patch from Petr Salinger <Petr.Salinger@seznam.cz> to fix
	  compilation on kfreebsd.

2006-09-11 08:11  nick

2006-08-10 01:59  james

	panel-plugin/wi_linux.c: Improved Linux support, thanks to An-Cheng
	Huang

2004-02-10 00:32  benny

	* panel-plugin/wavelan.c: Added code to autohide the plugin if the
	device is offline, that is the plugin is unable to detect a
	"carrier signal". This saves space in the panel.

2004-02-09 22:49  benny

	* panel-plugin/icons.xcf: Keep this here, so we can change the
	icons at any time.
