version 0.3.8:
	* Fixed a bug where we were quitting on theme engine failure, instead of
	  falling back to the default theme engine. Patch by
	  driehuis-at-playbeing.org. (Ticket #128)

version 0.3.7 (27-February-2007):
	* Fixed a compatibility issue with dbus-glib 0.72. Patch by Pawel Worach.
	 (Bug #95)
	* The background of the window in the standard theme is now just slightly
	  transparent when compiled against GTK+ 2.10 and when using a composite
	  manager. Patch by Matt Walton. (Ticket #110)
	* Fix several rendering glitches with the borders in the standard theme.
	* Fix a memory leak when removing a notification. Patch by Sven Wegener.
	 (Bug #105).
	* Added initial accessibility support with the standard theme engine.
	* Clicking anywhere in a notification should now close the notification.
	  This was happening only on the body text sometimes.

version 0.3.6 (8-October-2006):
	* Added a GConf key to allow users to specify which corner of the screen
 	  notifications should appear in. Patch by M.S. (Ticket #57)
 	* Added a Dutch translation from Wouter Bolsterlee. (Bug #55)
 	* Fixed compatibility problems with D-BUS v0.61. (Bugs #67, #75)
 	* A notification's timeout will now pause while the mouse is hovering over
 	  the notification. This allows users to respond to notifications without
 	  it suddenly disappearing before the user clicks. (Ticket #73)
 	* Fixed a crash under some icon themes where the base size of an icon
 	  was being returned as 0. (Bug #61)
 	* Fixed an assertion failure under newer versions of GTK+ during a
 	  notification's destruction. Patch by Ed Catmur. (Bug #77)
 	* Fixed type validation for raw icon data. Patch by Ed Catmur.
 	  (Bugs #75, #67)
 	* Fixed a problem where a replaces_id that points to a non-existant
 	  notification would cause a broken notification where timeouts and
 	  action invoking fails. In this case, a new ID is generated. Patch by
 	  Ed Catmur. (Bug #76)
	* Fixed a memory leak that occurred every time a notification went away.
	  Patch by Nick Schermer.

version 0.3.5 (26-April-2006):
	* Add three new required theme functions:
	  - theme_check_init - determines if the theme is compatible with the
	    running version of notification-daemon.
	  - get_theme_info - returns info on the theme.
	  - clear_notification_actions - Clears the notification action buttons
	    on the window.
	* Disabled the Bubble theme for this release. It's the source of too
	  many bugs.
	* Fix the scaling of different icon sizes. Now small icons display as
	  small, and larger icons are scaled down to 48x48.
	* Fixed a problem where icons were being clipped in notifications.
	  Patch by M.S. (Bug #21)
	* Fixed incorrect usage of GtkIconTheme. (Bug #38)
	* Fixed notifications with a timeout of 2147484ms or longer expiring
	  in less than a second. (Bug #22)
	* Fixed a bug where a notification would duplicate its actions when
	  updated. (Bug #30)
	* The Standard theme's countdown timer is now rendered using Cairo when
	  compiled against Gtk 2.8.0 or higher. This improves the timer by making
	  it antialiased.
	* Renamed notification-daemon.service to
	  org.freedesktop.Notifications.service.

version 0.3.4 (4-February-2006):
	* Added a Close button to notifications. This closed ticket #8. Thanks
	  to Michael Vogt for the basis of this patch.
	* Fixed a few bugs (including crashes) involving the freeing of
	  memory when notifications and theme enginers are destroyed.
	* Fixed the theme engines to be installed as unversioned libraries.
	  Thanks to Rodney Dawes for this patch.
	* Fixed a bug where the notification window was not realized, causing
	  a crash. This fixes bug #10.
	* Fixed a crash in the Bubble theme when clicking an action.
	* Fixed action ordering in the Bubble theme.
	* Made the destroy_notification, show_notification, hide_notification,
	  and set_notification_hints theme engine functions optional.
	* Added set_notification_timeout and notification_tick theme engine
	  functions.
	* Made several improvements to the Standard theme:
	  - The left-hand color stripe has been made smaller and now reflects
	    the urgency level set.
	  - Added a pie-based countdown timer for notifications containing
	    actions. This allows the user to see how long they have to react to
	    a notification.
	  - Converted the action links into buttons. These are now left-aligned
	    and make a reasonable attempt to find an appropriate stock icon.
	  - Allow the notification to be very short when no icons, body text or
	    actions are specified.

version 0.3.3 (25-January-2006):
	* Install and check for engines in
	  $(libdir)/notification-daemon-1.0/engines, as opposed to
	  $(libdir)/notification-daemon/engines.
	* Notifications no longer appear over full screen windows or
	  screensavers.
	* When using icontheme icons, the icon with a size closest to 48x48
	  is used. If the icon is smaller than 48x48, the icon is left unscaled,
	  but if it's larger, it's scaled down.

version 0.3.2 (23-January-2006):
	* Renamed the program back to notification-daemon.
	* Reverted the default look back to the notification-daemon 0.2.x look,
	  but with improvements, such as flexible arrow positioning and cleaner
	  action separators.
	* Updated to match the notification spec correctly.
	* Added the beginnings of theme support. The look from
	  notification-daemon v0.3.1 can be set in a GConf key, though it is
	  not yet fully functional.
	* Added back action support.
	* Added back support for D-BUS 0.36 and higher.
	* Added back the GetCapabilities and GetServerInformation calls.
	* Added back suppor for markup and hyperlinks in the new theme.
	* Fix several cases of C99 usage, and other compiler problems.
	* Fixed a bug where the desktop work area (the area excluding panels)
	  wasn't being taken into consideration when positioning notifications.
	* Fixed several crash bugs.

version 0.3.1:
	* First release of the notify daemon which supports the new 0.3.x protocol
	* Users of the older notification-daemon must make sure they uninstall it
	  as it will try to catch messages ment for the notify-daemon

version 0.2.4 (6-November-2005):
	* Support clicking on hyperlinks.

version 0.2.3 (6-November-2005):
	* Depends on libsexy for the URL label.

version 0.2.2 (10-August-2005):
	* Fixed several run-time issues on PPC and AMD64 (Martin Pitt)
	* Notifications that are created at the same time will disappear at
	  the same time.
	* Notifications that don't expire until the user clicks on them will
	  no longer block notifications that do expire.

	* Fixed hint support for D-BUS 0.3x.
	* Fixed a compile issue with GCC 4.0.
