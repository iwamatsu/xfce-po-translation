Xfce4-Mpc-Plugin
----------------

This is a simple Musicpd (http://www.musicpd.org) client plugin for the Xfce 4.4 panel.
Features :
- next/stop/play/pause/previous buttons
- current volume/status/playing track when mouse passes over the plugin
- decrease/increase volume with mousewheel
- show a simple playlist window upon middle-click, permitting to select a track to play
- toggle random/repeat in right-click menu
- launch configurable client (gmpc, xterm -e ncmpc,..) through right-click menu

To build it, you have two options :
- against libmpd libraries :
Get'em from your OS' repository/ports, or from source here : http://cms.qballcow.nl
It will be autodetected by pkg-config.
If libmpd is not installed in a standard directory, use --with-libmpd=path_to_libmpd.
- without libmpd, using simple-libmpd :
Since 0.2.0, i implemented a simple interface with mpd, using plain old sockets.
If libmpd is not found, it will be used as a fallback (or if you specify --without-libmpd)

./configure && make && su -c make install should suffice in most cases.

If it crashes, recompile it with --enable-debug=full, add it to the panel, attach gdb to it
(gdb -p `pidof xfce4-mpc-plugin` , continue) and report a bug with a complete backtrace.
