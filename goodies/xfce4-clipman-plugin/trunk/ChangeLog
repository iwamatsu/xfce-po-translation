	* Fix build for libtool 2.2 (or at least for ArchLinux)

2008-03-04	Mike Massonnet <mmassonnet@xfce.org>

	* === Release 0.8.1 ===
	* INSTALL: Delete autogenerate file
	* COPYING: Fix licence to GPL2 as it is the case for the c sources
	* configure.in.in: Bump minimum Xfce versions to 4.4.0
	* panel-plugin/clipman.c:
	  - (clipman_create_title) Generate fine UTF-8 titles with ellipsis (bug #3304)
	  - (clipman_create_menuitem) Use gtk_menu_item_new_with_label which
	  aligns the label on the left by default

2006-01-17	Nick Schermer <nick@xfce.org>

	* Improve configure files and Makefiles.
	* A huge version bump: we going from 0.5.99.1 to 0.8.0 for
	  the Xfce 4.4.0 release. This because there was an experimental
	  version with the 0.6.4 version number (not very smart, I know),

	  package.
