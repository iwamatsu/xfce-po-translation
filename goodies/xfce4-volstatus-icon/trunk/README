xfce4-volstatus-icon
====================

This is a program that sits around and does nothing until a removable device
is inserted.  Then it becomes an icon in the systray, which allows you to
easily (and safely) unmount/eject the device.

-> Requirements:

* gtk+ 2.10.0
* libxfcegui4 4.4.0
* ghal 0.1.0  (SVN only; see http://svn.xfce.org/svn/kelnos/ghal/trunk)

More documentation coming eventually...
