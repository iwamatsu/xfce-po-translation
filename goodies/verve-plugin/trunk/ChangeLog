2007-10-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Depend on pcre 5.0 which has pkg-config
	  support and thus is easier to detect during compilation.

2007-04-24	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: This bug has been driving me
	  crazy for months. It caused Verve to crash when entering
	  a command before the completion was initialized. 
	* panel-plugin/verve-history.c: Set the default history length
	  to 50 instead of 25. 

2007-01-17	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* autogen.sh, configure.in.in, po/LINGUAS: Add LINGUAS support,
	  so translators can add their languages without me having to
	  update configure.in.in.

2007-01-16	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* 0.3.5 released - really!
	* configure.in.in: Add missing languages.

2007-01-16	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xce.org>

	* configure.in.in, po/*.po, panel-plugin/*.{c,h},
	  scripts/verve-plugin.c: Update copyright years. 
	* THANKS: Honour all translators for their great work.

2007-01-16	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Add some more G_LOCK/G_UNLOCK
	  calls to protect the command completion. This fixes some
	  serious issues I had with Verve crashing when a command was
	  entered but the completion had not been loaded completely.

2006-11-27	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Properly modify the foreground 
	  color of the input entry while blinking - thanks to Mike 
	  Massonnet (mmassonnet@gmail.com) for the patch.

2006-08-24	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Finnish translations added.

2006-08-16	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c, panel-plugin/verve-history.c,
	  panel-plugin/verve.c, panel-plugin/verve-env.c: Apply patch
	  from Jasper, which removes several unused variables, evil
	  C99-style and avoids a double-free'd GList. Bug #2175.

2006-08-09	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c, panel-plugin/verve-history.c:
	  Make number of history items configurable. 

2006-08-08	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* scripts/verve-focus.c: Check if objects are != NULL before
	  unref'ing them. This fixes bug #2125 as reported by
	  huggie@earth.li.
	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Unhide the panel when Verve grabs
	  the focus. Re-hide it after a command was successfully
	  started.
	* configure.in.in: Depend on version 4.3.90.2svn-22691 of the
	  panel when the xfce_panel_plugin_set_hidden was introduced.

2006-08-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, po/*.po: Version 0.3.4 released, which fixes
	  a major verve-focus bug (#2113).

2006-08-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* scripts/verve-focus.c: Fix segfault caused by a DBusError
	  pointer not being initialized (bug #2113).

2006-08-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* README: Add optional D-BUS dependency.

2006-08-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>
	
	* 0.3.3 released.

2006-08-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* TODO: TODO list updated
	* THANKS: Translator credits updated
	* README: Dependencies updated

2006-08-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Makefile.am, panel-plugin/Makefile.am: Add dist-bzip2 automake
	  option and fix distcheck errors with D-BUS service information
	  generated by dbus-binding-tool. These changes will go into
	  0.3.3, of course.

2006-08-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Preparing for 0.3.3 release
	* configure.in.in, po/*.po: Bump version to 0.3.3.

2006-08-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugins/verve.c: Add "/?" to the URL expressions. This
	  way URIs with a trailing "/" are properly recognized as URIs.
	  Fixes bug #2102.

2006-08-01	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Executes commands when GDK_KP_Enter 
	  is pressed (in addition to GDK_Return). Fixes bug #2094.

2006-08-01	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* scripts/Makefile.am, scripts/verve-focus, scripts/verve-focus.c: 
	  Added a C program to replace the old Python verve-focus script. 
	  It's a lot faster than the old one and it calls 
	  org.xfce.Verve#GrabFocus instead of the 'OpenDialog' method.
	* panel-plugin/verve-dbus-service-infos.xml,
	  panel-plugin/verve-dbus-service.c: Added 'GrabFocus' method to the
	  org.xfce.Verve service. Also implemented a 'grab-focus' signal which
	  is emitted when the 'GrabFocus' method is called.
	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Connect to the 'grab-focus' signal of the
	  D-BUS service. Use one method to handle both, 'open-dialog' and
	  'grab-focus'.

2006-07-26	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c, panel-plugin/verve-env.c: Properly sort
	  items of the completion list and also insert new items using
	  g_list_insert_sorted. This fixes bug #2074 (reported by Nick Arend).

2006-07-26	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, panel-plugin/verve-dbus-service.c: Add switch to
	  use different D-BUS flags when requesting a service name depending
	  on the available D-BUS version (the flags changed with 0.60).

2006-07-26	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-dbus-service-infos.xml: Add the same 'OpenDialog'
	  method to the 'org.xfce.Verve' interface as we already support in
	  'org.xfce.RunDialog'.
	* scripts/verve-focus: Use 'OpenDialog' method of 'org.xfce.Verve'
	  interface to make sure we actually target a Verve instance and no
	  other 'org.xfce.RunDialog' providers.
	* panel-plugin/verve-dbus-service.c: Add
	  DBUS_NAME_FLAGS_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT to the 'org.xfce.Verve' name 
	  request. I bet users expect the last created Verve instance to have 
	  the ownership and to be focused when verve-focus is executed. Don't
	  do this for 'org.xfce.RunDialog' (until someone complains), because
	  I suppose a user using Verve doesn't want to use other RunDialog
	  providers.

2006-07-25	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* scripts/verve-focus: Call 'import pygtk; pygtk.require("2.0")' before
	  importing the gtk module.
	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Connect to "focus-out-event" of the input
	  field in order to stop blinking whenever any other widget gains the
	  focus (this fixes a bug reported by Nikolas Arend).

2006-07-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-env.c: Remove debug statements.
	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Use XfceTitledDialog instead of the 
	  old plain GTK one. 
	* panel-plugin/verve.desktop.in.in, panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c:
	  Use "utilities-terminal" icon instead of "Terminal". 
	* configure.in.in, po/*.po: Version bump to 0.3.2. 

2006-07-13	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Lock command completion using
	  G_LOCK_DEFINE_STATIC. This replaces the global GDK locks and should
	  avoid random crashes when the worker thread (which loads contents of 
	  $PATH) and the panel plugin try to access the completion at the same
	  time.

2006-07-11	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Use gdk_threads_enter/leave to lock
	  completion access (only one thread is allowed to access it at once).
	* panel-plugin/verve-dbus-service.c: Remove C++ comment style.

2006-07-11	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* scripts/Makefile.am: Add verve-focus to EXTRA_DIST (it's missing in
	  the 0.3.1 tarball.
	* panel-plugin/verve-env.c, panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Implemented 
	  threaded, asynchronous loading of $PATH entries. This avoids slower
	  panel startup if $PATH includes slow media folders.
	  Use more precise filters when loading the binaries (check for
	  executable flag, avoid duplicate entries etc.).

2006-06-17	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Added Italian translation to the XDT_I18N list.

2006-04-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Bump version.

2006-04-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Fix adding to command history when
	  history is empty.

2006-04-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* scripts/Makefile.am: Applied patch by Yves-Alexis Perez 
	  <corsac@corsac.net>, which fixes an error during installation.
	  of the scripts/ directory.

2006-04-08	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, po/el.po: Greek translations by Stavros 
	  Giannouris <stavrosg2002@freemail.gr> added.

2006-04-08	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Applied Daichi's patch (which adds pl to the
	  translations).

2006-04-03	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Fix compilation error without 
	  D-BUS.

2006-04-03	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* scripts/Makefile.am, scripts/verve-focus, Makefile.am,
	  configure.in.in: Added verve-focus script and a Makefile
	  to install it into $(bindir). 

2006-04-03	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-env.{h,c}: Remove all the shell stuff. As I
	  dropped the idea of user-defined commands this is just annoying
	  overhead. Code cleaned up.
	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Cleaned up the code. Avoid to add
	  a command to the history if it's the same as the previously added
	  command. This fixes bug #6900. Entries from the command history
	  now appear in the auto-completion results.
	* panel-plugin/verve-history.{c,h}: Another bug fixed: Don't write
	  more than 25 commands to the cache. I'll add an option for this
	  to the preferences dialog later, so that the user can choose
	  how many commands he wants to have saved. Code cleaned up.
	* panel-plugin/verve.c: Code cleaned up.

2006-03-25	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Enhance flash highlighting.

2006-03-25	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Implement flash timeout in order to
	  notify the user when Verve got the focus through the D-BUS service.
	  Unregister the timeout as soon as a mouse button or key is pressed.

2006-03-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/Makefile.am: Add hints for building 
	  verve-dbus-service-infos.h from verve-dbus-service-infos.xml during
	  make.

2006-03-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* TODO: Remove startup notification, terminal startup support.
	* scripts/verve-focus.py: Add helper script for focussing Verve
	  using the org.xfce.RunDialog D-BUS service.
	* panel-plugin/verve-dbus-service.c, panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: 
	  Use a signal ("open-dialog") callback for grabbing the focus rather 
	  than using VerveDBusService "plugin" and "input" properties. This
	  moves GUI stuff out of VerveDBusService again.
	* panel-plugin/*.{c,h}: Wrap function parameters and clean up the 
	  code.
	* configure.in.in: Remove libstartup-notification from dependencies.

2006-03-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Fix completion loading. Re-add 
	  accidently removed line to create the completion at startup.
	  Add terminal exec feature using the <Control> key.
	  panel-plugin/verve.{c,h}: Add terminal exec feature. Open
	  directories with exo-open, just like URLs and eMail addresses.

2006-03-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Remove debug print statements.

2006-03-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-dbus-service.c: Add "plugin" property and call
	  xfce_panel_focus_widget () when the "OpenDialog" method is called.
	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Set "plugin" property of D-BUS 
	  service.

2006-03-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* verve/*.{c,h}: Moved all source files to panel-plugin/.
	* panel-plugin/verve-dbus-services.*: Implemented org.xfce.RunDialog 
	  D-BUS service. 
	* tests/*.*: Removed test script.
	* configure.in.in, Makefile.am: Add optional D-BUS support.

2006-03-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* verve/verve-db.{c,h}, tests/Makefile.am, panel-plugin/Makefile.am, 
	  verve/verve.{c,h}: Removed unused verve command database.
	* verve/verve-history.h: Include <libxfce4util/libxfce4util.h>.
	* verve/verve.c: Fixed error handling which made the plugin crash on
	  shell errors (this fixes bug #6663).

2006-03-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Fix version string (use 0.2.0 instead of 0.2).

2006-03-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Fixed another resize bug. The user-defined width will now
	  be used no matter how the panel behaves.

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Added config.h include. This 
	  fixes translation problems (translations weren't displayed 
	  before).

2006-02-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c: Return TRUE in 
	  verve_plugin_update_size.
	* configure.in.in: Rename fr_CH to fr.

2006-02-12	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	  make use of the new focus grab method for external plugins.

2006-02-12	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Fix use of unterminated supported_shells array. Use 
	  G_N_ELEMENTS() instead of g_strv_length(). Thanks to
	  Jasper for the patch.

2006-02-11	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/verve-plugin.c, panel-plugin/configure.in.in:

	* Removed XFCE_PANEL_PLUGIN call from configure.in.in

2006-02-07	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>
