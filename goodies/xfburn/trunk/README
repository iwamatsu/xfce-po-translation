xfburn
------

Version 0.3.2, 2008-07-xx

http://www.xfce.org/projects/xfburn/

An easy to use burning software for the xfce desktop environment (but of
course will work with others). It uses libburn and libisofs as a backend, in
difference to most other GUI programs at the moment. Visit
http://www.libburnia-project.org/ for more information about these libraries.

==============================================================================
Functionality
-------------

xfburn is still a new program, and does not yet do all common burning related
tasks.

Currently implemented is:
 * Create data compositions
  - Burn to CD or DVD
  - Create ISO images
 * Burn ISO images
 * Blank discs
 * Format and deformat DVD-RW discs

----------------------
Experimential Features
----------------------

 * Audio CD support
Now included is some very basic audio CD support. Right now only CD-quality, 
uncompressed (PCM) Wave files can be added to an audio compilation. Use i.e.
your favority audio player with a disc writer output mode / plugin to
decompress your existing audio files. If .wav files are added to the
compilation, their headers get checked to make sure they are of the right
format. Note that this check is not very well tested (in particular it's not
likely to work on big-endian machines like PowerPC), since it is likely to
get replaced in the near future.

==============================================================================
Requirements
------------
 * libisofs version 0.6.2 or newer
 * libburn version 0.4.2 or newer

Optional, but highly recommended
--------------------------------
 * hal        (required for notification of disc eject / insert and
               also for automatic disc unmounting)
 * thunar-vfs (required for some drag and drop code, icons and automatic disc 
               unmounting)

The author works with both hal and thunar-vfs enabled, so there might be the
occasional bug that breaks compilation without these components. Xfburn should
work without these optional components, but it is not well tested at all.
Should something not compile or work as expected, please report a bug, and it
will get fixed.

==============================================================================
Future Plans
------------

Missing functionality that we plan to add:
 * Save and load compositions
 * Verification
 * Burn audio CDs
 * Copy discs (needs backend support)
 * Automatic checksum creation
 * Blu-ray support
 * Plugin support

There is no, and never will be, a timeline for these. Let us know if you think
something is missing on this list. If you really need something implemented,
feel free to help us out :-).

==============================================================================
Bugs & Feedback
---------------

Any comments are welcome! We aim to make xfburn a very easily usable program.
So if you think something could be implemented differently, feel free to speak
up and it will be considered. Please send all feedbacks to xfburn@xfce.org, or
use the xfce mailing lists. Bugs are best placed in the xfce bugtracker at
http://bugzilla.xfce.org/
