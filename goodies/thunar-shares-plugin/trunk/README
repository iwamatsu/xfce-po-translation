What is it?
===========

thunar-shares-plugin allows you to quickly share a folder using Samba
from Thunar (the XFCE file manager) without requiring root access.


Required packages
=================

thunar-shares-plugin depends on the following packages:

 - thunarx - 0.8.0 or above
 - thunar-vfs - 0.8.0 or above
 - gtk+-2.0 - 2.12.0 or above
 - glib-2.0 - 2.10.0 or above


Installation
============

(For information about how to setup Samba correctly see bellow)

If you downloaded a source tarball from the download page, you can run:

  ./configure --prefix=$(pkg-config --variable prefix thunarx-1)

in order to configure the plugin.

If you fetched the source from SVN, you have to use this command: 

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=$(pkg-config --variable prefix thunarx-1)

After that you should be able to build and install the plugin, using
the following commands (remember you have to be root for that!):

  make && make install

Samba Setup
===========

If your are using (X)ubuntu 8.04 or above you don't need to do 
all the setup: just add your user to the group 'sambashare' and re-login
after install the plugin.

For non (X)ubuntu users the Samba setup is:

 1) Create a group (must be done as root): 

    export USERSHARES_DIR="/var/lib/samba/usershares"
    export USERSHARES_GROUP="sambashare"
    mkdir -p ${USERSHARES_DIR}
    groupadd ${USERSHARES_GROUP}
    chown root:${USERSHARES_GROUP} ${USERSHARES_DIR}
    chmod 01770 ${USERSHARES_DIR}

 2) Use the following /etc/samba/smb.conf:

    [global]
    workgroup = WORKGROUP
    security = share
    usershare path = /var/lib/samba/usershares
    usershare max shares = 100
    usershare allow guests = yes
    usershare owner only = yes

 3) Add the samba group to your user (replace your_username by your login): 

    usermod -a -G ${USERSHARES_GROUP} your_username

 4) Restart Samba daemons

    Ex: /etc/init.d/samba restart

 5) Logout and login your user (your_username)
