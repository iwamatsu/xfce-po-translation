TODO for thunar-shares-plugin
=======================================================================

  * Add emblems to shared folders (Thunar doesn't allow to add/remove
    emblembs from plugins yet).
    - Maybe we can use tdb: ${HOME}/.cache/Thunar/metafile.tdb

  * Maybe some help button at shares-admin dialog.

  * We need to review the permissions hierarchy check:
    (libshares/libshares-util.c: tsp_check_perms)

MILESTONE 0.20
=======================================================================

  * 12 chars share-name check should warn the user, isn't a error.
