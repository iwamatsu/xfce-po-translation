What is it?
===========

thunar-volman is an extension for the Thunar File Manager, which enables
automatic management of removable drives and media. For example, if
thunar-volman is installed and configured properly, and you plug in your
digitcal camera, it will automatically spawn your preferred photo application
and import the new pictures from your camera.

It was designed to look and behave similar to gnome-volume-manager to get
consistent removable drive and media management in Xfce and GNOME. This is
to help GNOME refugees and people using both Xfce and GNOME (i.e. having to
use GNOME at the office).


Required packages
=================

thunar-volman depends on the following packages:

 - Thunar 0.5.1svn or above
 - libexo 0.3.1.13svn or above
 - D-BUS 0.34 or above (esp. the dbus-glib devel package)
 - HAL 0.5.0 or above (esp. the libhal devel package)


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions. For more
detailed information, visit the thunar-volman website at
http://www.xfce.org/~benny/projects/thunar-volman/index.html.


Debugging Support
=================

thunar-volman currently supports four different levels of debugging support, which
can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output of
`configure --help'):

  `full'	Use this if you want to debug thunar-volman to locate a bug.
		The build will most probably be noticably slower. This is also
		recommended for people that want to develop thunar-volman stuff.

  `yes'		This is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all
  		kinds of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run
		slower.

  `minimum'	This is the default for release builds, and presents the
  		recommended behaviour.

  `no'		Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know
  		exactly what you do.
