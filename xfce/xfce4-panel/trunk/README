What is it?
===========

'xfce4-panel' is the panel of the Xfce Desktop Environment. It is no longer 
modeled after the CDE panel like the first versions of xfce.
This version is based on GTK+ and should have all the advantages that come 
with this toolkit (see http://www.gtk.org).

The panel provides program lauchers with, optionally, non-hierarchical menus 
(easier to read at a glance), and several panel 'plugins' like a clock and a
pager. Additional plugins may be installed separately.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.


Plugins
=======

Starting from version 4.4, the Xfce Panel support two types of plugins:
 * Internal plugins. These are loadable modules, using the gmodule interface.
 * External plugins. These are separate programs that are embedded into the
   panel using the GtkPlug/GtkSocket mechanism.

For more information about the panel plugins framework, you can read the API
documentation (http://www.xfce.org/documentation/4.4/api/libxfce4panel/) or
the panel plugins how to (http://wiki.xfce.org/panel_plugins_howto).


KIOSK mode
==========

The Xfce Panel supports the KIOSK mode introduced with libxfce4util 4.1.13.
It provides the following KIOSK capabilities:

CustomizePanel: Only users with this capability will be allowed to customize 
their panel (add panel plugins, configure panel plugins, add launchers, etc.). 
This is similar to setting the environment va- riable XFCE_DISABLE_USER_CONFIG 
with the old panel.

So a sample xfce4-panel section in your kioskrc might look like this:

<-- start snip -->
[xfce4-panel]
CustomizePanel=%powerusers,foo
<-- end snip -->

This allows only users in the group powerusers and the user foo to customize
their panels.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system:
