General
=======
* Improve the code layout, so it is consistent and easy to read. We should also
  add more comments inside functions. (Nick & Jasper)

Launcher
========
* Finish the orientation code. I have no idea what to do here, because we
  have no solution for the customizable arrow direction yet. (Nick)
* We also need a good way to popup the launcher menu when we drag over the
  button. (Nick)
  
  
Panel
=====
* Re-evaluate interfaces. Make sure not too much implementation detail is
  visible between separate parts of the panel.


Libxfce4panel
=============
* In xfce-panel-plugin-iface we use g_object_{get,set} all over the place,
  this should be changed to reduce the number of relocations.
* Create some macros for common used code in plugins. This should make writing
  consistent plugins easier.


Tasklist
========
* We're going to rewrite the tasklist, see bug #2680 for more information. (Nick)


--- End of sane plans ---

Blue Sky
========

* Transparency. The way cairo is integrated into gtk means we will need to
  write our own widgets for panel plugins, because every widget with a window
  needs to handle this separately :( See
  http://www.loculus.nl/xfce/files/panel-cairo-20070125.patch for a quick
  hack. 
  It would be much nicer if transparency were a style property, configurable
  by a gtkrc file, but I don't think that will happen any time soon...
