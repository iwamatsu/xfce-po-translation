2007-01-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb-jpeg.c: Use Exif embedded thumbnails
	  if available, which reduces the amount of data that must be
	  retrieved from a camera to around 50k instead of the whole JPEG
	  image, which can be up to several mega bytes.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb.c
	  (thunar_vfs_thumb_factory_generate_thumbnail): Do not scale down
	  thumbnails extracted from JPEG images that use the rather common
	  size 160x120 pixels, to save some time and avoid messing up the

	  the active mount points whenever a volume changes.

2007-01-12	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-io-local-xfer.c(tvilx_copy_regular): Drop

	  wasn't detected previously.

2007-01-12	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Finally fix crash on platforms where
	  sizeof(GType) != sizeof(gint). Bug #2726.

2007-01-10	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-gdk-extensions.{c,h}: Add new helper function 
	  thunar_gdk_screen_get_active(), which returns the currently
	  active screen, i.e. the screen which currently contains the
	  mouse pointer.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c: Use the new ExoMountPoint
	  module to query active and configured mount points.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c: Add new signals "device-added"
	  and "device-removed", which correspond to the HAL signals of the
	  same name, and are emitted by the volume manager whenever a new
	  device is added or an existing device is removed. This is an
	  internal support mechanism for the volume manager integration of
	  Thunar and should not be used by other applications.
	* thunar/thunar-application.c: Add hooks for the thunar-volman,
	  which, if installed and enabled, will be spawned whenever a new
	  device is reported by HAL. This enables lightweight volume management
	  avoiding an additional daemon, as Thunar already listens for HAL
	  events anyway. Note that Thunar doesn't provide any functionality
	  by itself here. It just acts a proxy between HAL and thunar-volman.
	* docs/README.thunarrc, thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Add preference
	  MiscVolumeManagement, which controls whether volume manager should
	  be enabled.
	* docs/references/thunar-vfs/: Add missing enums to the manual.

	  directory contents.

2007-01-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c(thunar_shortcuts_view_init): Ellipsize
	  long shortcut names, but make sure "File System" still fits into the
	  side pane.

2007-01-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c,

	  dots from the error message.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-freebsd.c, docs/README.volumes,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c: Use exo-mount to mount, eject
	  and unmount volumes instead of relying on external utilities that
	  don't always behave properly. Bug #2715.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c: Add ability to mount floppy
	  drives using exo-mount. Bug #2075.
	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Fix distcheck.
	* po/de.po: Some german translation love.

2007-01-03	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, docs/manual/, thunar/main.c, thunar/thunar-dialogs.c:
	  Update copyright dates.
	* po-doc/Thunar.pot, po-doc/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Drop obsolete strings.
	* po/de.po: Update german translations.

2007-01-03	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/main.c(main): Need to initialize GThread first.

2006-12-31	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache.c: Add ability to
	  load custom thumbnailers from .desktop files. Drop the hardcoded
	  font thumbnailer.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-font-thumbnailer-1.desktop.in,
	  thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Install a .desktop file for the font
	  thumbnailer.
	* docs/manual/, po-doc/: Update the user guide with detailed information
	  about the custom thumbnailers.

2006-12-31	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.c(_thunar_vfs_init): Do not maintain more than
	  four unused threads, and stop unused threads after ten seconds of
	  idle time (requires GLib 2.10).

2006-12-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-io-local-xfer.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-os-bsd.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-os-generic.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-path.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-path-private.h,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.c: Add _thunar_vfs_path_child()
	  as internal implementation of thunar_vfs_path_relative(), that does
	  not perform the expensive sanity checking for release builds.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-io-local.{c,h}: List folders parallel again,
	  with up to four threads collecting file infos at the same time.
	  Additionally, in order to avoid the costly inode lookups when
	  listing folder contents, we change to the requested folder and
	  use relative file names (requires locking, since the current
	  working directory is per-process rather than per-thread). Last,
	  the executable sanity checking was optimized for the common case
	  of a binary or shellscript, which should further improve the
	  loading performance of large folders with binaries.

2006-12-28	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/: Several improvements to the GtkTreeModel implementations
	  that should further speed up loading really large folders. For the
	  icon view, the real bottleneck is still Pango.

2006-12-21	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.c: Apply Brian's
	  patch to properly initialize the gettext textdomain for thunar-vfs.
	  Bug #2543.

2006-12-21	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-location-entry.c(thunar_location_entry_init):
	  Make sure the down button in the location bar doesn't get too
	  large. Bug #2582.

2006-12-21	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_statusbar_text):
	  Don't try to open non-regular files to gather detailed statistics
	  to avoid hanging Thunar forever while trying to read from a named
	  pipe. Bug #2655.

2006-11-26	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_init): Add shortcuts <control>1,

	  files did not change to avoid flicker in menus for files being
	  downloaded, etc.

2006-11-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c(thunar_launcher_sendto_idle): Do not
	  display the "Desktop (Create Link)" sendto-action for trashed
	  files, because symbolic links cannot be created for files in

	* plugins/thunar-tpa/Makefile.am: Starting with version 0.72
	  dbus-binding-tool now requires the --prefix command line option
	  even though it isn't used for anything. Bug #2528.

	* docs/README.volumes, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c: Apply patch
	  from Bernhard Walle <bernhard.walle@gmx.de> to add support for

2006-11-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_changed): Changing the
	  model currently in used by a GtkEntryCompletion is very slow with
	  recent GTK+ versions. Therefore we disconnect the model first when
	  changing the folder and reconnect it to the entry completion after-
	  wards. Bug #1681.

2006-11-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c(thunar_shortcuts_view_drag_leave):

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c(thunar_vfs_volume_hal_update):
	  Do not use the deprecated HAL policy framework. Bug #2475.

	  deleted.

2006-11-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-tree-model.c(thunar_tree_model_item_files_removed):
	  The "row-has-child-toggled" signal must not be emitted if the
	  children of the row did not change, otherwise newer GtkTreeView's
	  will loose sync with the model and probably crash. Bug #2372.

2006-11-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-location-entry.c: Merge drop-down menu making shortcuts
	  accessible even if the classic file manager look'n'feel is being

	  Use preferences-desktop-default-applications for the "Recommended
	  Applications" group.
	* thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-chooser-model.{c,h}:
	  Use the ExoCellRendererIcon to render the icons instead of preloading
	  the icons in the model. Don't display the expanders with GTK+ 2.9
	  and above.

2006-10-28	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-job-private.h, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-job.c:

	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c(thunar_properties_dialog_init):

2006-10-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Display the real mime type as

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c
	  (thunar_standard_view_set_selected_files): Place the cursor on the
	  first selected file. Bug #2368.

2006-10-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Depend on exo 0.3.1.11 because thunar-uca requires
	  exo-open to support the --working-directory switch.

2006-09-21	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-dbus-client.c, thunar/thunar-dbus-service.c: Fix build
	  with latest dbus-glib. Bug #2263.

	  menu of the file manager.
	* docs/reference/thunarx/: Update the thunarx reference manual.
	* thunar/thunar-dnd.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-location-button.c,

	  Fix several race conditions that were introduced over time and
	  prevented the "new-files" job handling from working properly with
	  Gamin and automatic folder reload. Bug #2199.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c: The file must not be dropped from the hash
	  table in the dispose() function, but only when finalize is called,
	  because dispose() may be invoked more than once and hence we might
	  drop a newly created ThunarFile object with the same path from
	  the hash table.

2006-09-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, Makefile.am: Place automake options into

	  thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Allow
	  to change the icon of .desktop files. Bug #2150.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Update german translations.

2006-09-09	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-io-local-xfer.c: Keep the
	  modification time when copying files. Bug #2244.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-io-local-xfer.c
	  (_thunar_vfs_io_local_xfer_next_path): Further reduce the number
	  of relocations.

2006-09-09	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add missing check for setmntent().

2006-09-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-os-bsd.c(_thunar_vfs_os_scandir): Allocate the
	  directory scan buffer on the heap rather than the stack to avoid
	  crashes on systems with very small thread stacks. Bug #2269.

2006-09-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in.in, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c:
	  Add support for FreeBSD to the HAL based volume manager.

2006-09-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Fix typo, -DNDEBUG instead of -NDEBUG.

2006-09-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-session-client.c(thunar_session_client_connect): Make
	  sure Thunar is restarted prior to xfdesktop, so the trash support
	  in xfdesktop works as expected even if D-Bus autoactivation is not
	  setup properly.

2006-09-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-info.c: Update the icon mime icon lookup
	  to try icon names from Icon Naming Spec first, and fallback to
	  legacy GNOME icon names.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c: Use the thumbnail database to load
	  SVG icons from the icon theme, because loading SVG is quite slow
	  and takes a lot more memory than loading and scaling PNG icons
	  from the thumbnail database.
	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c(thunar_properties_dialog_init):
	  Ellipsize the kind label at the end.
	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: No need to keep the "reload"
	  signal id around.

2006-09-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Post-release version bump.

2006-09-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  <szymon_maestro@gazeta.pl>.

2006-09-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: GMemChunk in GLib 2.10 and above is not
	  only inefficient, but also continously leaks memory. Therefore we
	  don't use GMemChunk anymore, but use GSList directly.

2006-09-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/Thunar.xml, docs/Makefile.am: Add manual page for Thunar.
	  Bug #1650.

	  thunar/thunar-window.c: Add "Empty Trash" action to "File" and
	  folder context menu, which is only visible when displaying the
	  trash root folder. Bug #2238.

2006-08-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-column-editor.c, thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-gtk-extensions.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-location-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c, thunar/thunar-create-dialog.c:
	  Add helper function thunar_gtk_label_set_a11y_relation(), which sets
	  up the ATK_RELATION_LABEL_FOR for a label and a widget, so we don't
	  need to repeat the same code over and over again.

2006-08-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-location-button.c,
	  thunar/thunar-shortcuts-model.c: Add desktop shortcut to the
	  shortcuts pane, and use a special icon for the desktop folder.
	  Bug #2235.
	* thunar/thunar-chooser-button.c, thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-gtk-extensions.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c,
	  thunar/thunar-renamer-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.c, thunar/thunar-tree-view.c: Add helper
	  method thunar_gtk_menu_run(), which takes care of running a GtkMenu
	  in a separate main loop, placing the menu on the appropriate screen
	  first.

2006-08-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/README.gtkrc, docs/README.thunarrc, thunar/: Revert location bar
	  related changes to the previous user interface, because the new user
	  interface wastes too much space, and makes the file manager look busy.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Synchronize file list.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Update german translations.

2006-08-28	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Add warning text to the window when running
	  as super user. Bug #2218.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Update german translations.

2006-08-28	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c(action_entries), thunar/thunar-stock.{c,h}:
	  Use "gnome-fs-home" instead of "gtk-home" as icon for Home for
	  consistency.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(action_entries): Fix a mnemonic clash.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_current_directory_changed):
	  Use "<folder> - File Manager" for the title to make it easier to
	  indentify file manager windows in the taskbar.
	* thunar/thunar-create-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: No need to include thunar-stock.h
	  here anymore.
	* thunar/thunar-history.c(thunar_history_init): Consider "back" as
	  an important action wrt to the appearance in the toolbar.
	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Decouple the
	  location bar from the toolbar by separating them into "Location Bar"
	  and "Main Toolbar". Bug #1349.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c, docs/README.thunarrc: Add new options
	  LastLocationBarVisible and LastToolbarVisible, which control the
	  visibility of the "Location Bar" and "Main Toolbar". Add new option
	  LastNavigationBarEntry, which controls whether the navigation bar
	  will display the path entry widget by default.
	* thunar/thunar-gtk-extensions.{c,h}: Add new helper function
	  thunar_gtk_action_set_tooltip(), which changes the tooltip of
	  a GtkAction.

	  thunar/thunar-tree-pane.c, thunar/thunar-tree-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Synchronize
	  the latest user interface changes in GtkFileChooser. This way the
	  location bar will be used for both the path bar and the path entry
	  widgets, and a simple toggle button controls whether the path entry
	  is visible. This way (nearly) the full width of the window is avail-
	  able for the path bar. Bug #2060.
	* thunar/thunar-gtk-extensions.{c,h}: Drop now obsolete helper function
	  thunar_gtk_action_group_create_tool_item() as it's no longer used.
	* thunar/thunar-location-dialog.c(thunar_location_dialog_init): Reduce
	  translation overhead and don't use a mnemonic here. It was pretty
	  useless anyway.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c, docs/README.thunarrc: Remove now
	  obsolete option LastLocationBar.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Synchronize file list.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Update german translations.

2006-08-26	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(action_entries): Do not register an
	  additional accelerator for "Select all Files", instead rely on the
	  key bindings registered by ExoIconView/GtkTreeView. Bug #2036.

2006-08-26	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* plugins/thunar-uca/thunar-uca-model.c(thunar_uca_model_parse_argv):
	  Substitute %d properly. Bug #2214.
	* thunar/thunar-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am,
	  thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c, thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.c: Use
	  exo_gdk_pixbuf_frame() instead of thunar_gdk_pixbuf_frame() and drop
	  the GdkPixbuf extensions.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-pixbuf-thumbnailer.c, thunar/Makefile.am: Use
	  exo_gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_max_size() for the pixbuf thumbnai-
	  ler.
	* configure.in.in, README, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-font-thumbnailer.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache.c,
	  thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Import the font thumbnailer, which uses
	  freetype 2.x (if available) to generate a thumbnail of a font file.
	* plugins/thunar-uca/thunar-uca-editor.c: Use ExoIconChooserDialog to
	  select an icon for a custom action.

	* configure.in.in, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-private.h,
	  thunar/thunar-private.h: Use -DNDEBUG in release builds and
	  -GG_ENABLE_DEBUG only for full debug builds.

2006-08-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-path.c(thunar_vfs_path_list_to_string): Use

2006-08-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-private.h, thunar-vfs/*.c: Several cleanups

	  breaking the strict aliasing rules of the compiler.
	* configure.in.in: Enable compilation with --enable-debug=yes or
	  --enable-debug=full and compilers other than gcc.
	* configure.in.in, thunar/thunar-private.h, thunar/thunar-*.c:
	  Disable extra debugging in release builds, Thunar received
	  quite a lot of stabilization now. This affects only the internals
	  of the binary. The public API is still fully sanity checked.

	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb.c, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache.c: Drop the dependen-
	  cy of libthunar-vfs on GConf, which was required to load the GNOME
	  thumbnailers. Instead there's now an external program, which genera-
	  tes an mmap()able file that contains a mapping between a mime type
	  and the thumbnailer used to generate thumbnails for that mime type.
	  Bug #2131.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-pixbuf-thumbnailer.c, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb-pixbuf.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb.c: Put the gdk-pixbuf thumbnailer into
	  a separate program, which gets registered via the thumbnailers.cache
	  file, so we don't need any extra overhead for thumbnails that can be
	  generated using gdk-pixbuf.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor-private.h,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.c: Add a simple helper method
	  _thunar_vfs_monitor_handle_get_path() that returns the path for

	  and the path around for monitored resources.

	  thunar/thunar-launcher.c,
	  thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_check_completion_idle):
	  Use strncmp() instead of g_str_has_prefix() where it makes sense. Try
	  to avoid g_str_has_suffix() if checking only for a single character.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_drag_motion):
	  Deny XdndDirectSave0 and _NETSCAPE_URL drops to locations in the

	  permanently if atleast one non-local (not necessary trash) file is
	  included in the file list.
	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_changed): Do not try

	* configure.in.in, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-os-bsd.c: OpenBSD doesn't

	* thunar/thunar-util.c(thunar_util_time_from_rfc3339): Fix typo.

	* thunar/thunar-file.c, thunar/thunar-util.{c,h}: Add new helper method
	  thunar_util_time_from_rfc3339(), which parses a date string to a time
	  value, using strptime() if available. Use the method to parse the
	  deletion date string for trashed resources, so the deletion date will
	  be displayed properly even on systems that lack strptime().
	* thunar/thunar-util.c(thunar_util_humanize_file_time): Use
	  g_date_set_time() to enable compilation with GLib 2.6/2.8.
	  Hopefully nobody will still use GLib 2.6/2.8 in 2038.

2006-07-31	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-dbus-service-infos.xml, thunar/thunar-dbus-service.c:

	  thunarx/thunarx-file-info.c: Register the "changed" and "renamed"

	  properly display the signals (gtk-doc doesn't invoke base_init() for
	  interfaces). Bug #1418.
	* docs/reference/thunarx/tmpl/thunarx-property-page-provider.sgml,
	  docs/reference/thunarx/tmpl/thunarx-property-page.sgml,
	  thunarx/thunarx-property-page-provider.c: Properly document

	  cancellation of the rename operation.
	* thunar/thunar-renamer-dialog-ui.xml,thunar/thunar-renamer-model.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-renamer-dialog.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am: Some polish on
	  the dialog and the model. Allow users to add/remove files using the
	  context menu. Add a standalone mode in which the bulk rename dialog
	  appears as standalone application and which can be invoked through the
	  D-BUS service. Bug #1597.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_action_rename):

	  Makefile.am: Rearrange the .desktop file handling.
	* Makefile.am, Thunar-bulk-rename.desktop.in.in, ThunarBulkRename.in:

	  part of bug #1602.
	* docs/reference/thunarx/: Update the API docs.
	* thunar/thunar-renamer-dialog.c(thunar_renamer_dialog_context_menu),

	  constantly while generating thumbnails.
	* thunar/thunar-gobject-extensions.c: Register a transformation func-
	  tion string->uint.
	* plugins/thunar-sbr/thunar-sbr-case-renamer.c
	  (thunar_sbr_case_renamer_new): More consistent naming scheme for the

	  thunar/Makefile.am, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Merge the bulk

	  rename multiple files at once. Bug #1416.

	  plugins/Makefile.am: Merge stable version of the thunar-sbr exten-
	  sion ("Simple Builtin Renamers"), which provides "Search & Replace",

	  thunar/main.c(main): Initialize the additional GType transformations
	  on startup, rather than in the ThunarPreferences class constructor.

2006-03-20	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, configure.in.in, po/POTFILES.in,

2006-03-20	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.c(thunar_icon_renderer_render): Render
	  the icon properly when the widget state is insensitive.

2006-03-18	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  write copied directories.

2006-03-16	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.c(thunar_vfs_volume_lookup_icon_name):
	  Fix typo, s/gnome-dev-dvdrom/gnome-dev-disc-dvdrom/.

2006-03-16	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-tree-view.c: gtk_tree_view_get_visible_range() is only
	  available in GTK+ 2.8 and above.

2006-03-16	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-xfer.c: Also chmod u+rw the target file if we
	  are not the owner of the source file.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-path.c(thunar_vfs_path_to_uri): Double checking
	  bufsize doesn't make much sense.

2006-03-16	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Add backspace as shortcut for "Back".
	* thunar/thunar-application.c: Save accelerators on exit and restore
	  them on startup. This way users can customize all shortcuts to their
	  needs and Thunar will remember those shortcuts.
	* FAQ, docs/manual/C/Thunar.xml.in: Update the documentation.
	* po-doc/Thunar.pot, po-doc/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-03-16	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c, thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Yet another attempt to set appropriate
	  labels/tooltips for the cut/copy/paste actions. Cut/copy/paste in file
	  manager is really different to other applications, not the actual data
	  is stored in the clipboard, but only the location where to find the
	  data.
	* thunar/thunar-tree-view.c: Add drop site support and clipboard
	  actions.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Update german translations. Use "Ordner" instead of
	  "Verzeichnis" to be consistent with the shared-mime-info and Gtk+

	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.h, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-freebsd.c: Improve the volume manager
	  implemenation. The ThunarVfsVolumeManager and ThunarVfsVolume inter-
	  faces are now abstract base classes, with the implementation API
	  completely separated from the public API. The HAL backend was fixed
	  to work around a strange HAL bug, where 'volume.is_mounted' is FALSE
	  for mounted volumes (instead of trusting HAL, we ask the kernel to
	  make sure we always display the proper state). Also, new signals
	  "mounted", "pre-unmount" and "unmounted" were added to both
	  ThunarVfsVolume and ThunarVfsVolumeManager, to allow applications to
	  perform certain actions for these events.
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/: Update the API documentation.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Whenever the user requests to unmount a
	  volume, check if the window displays a folder on this volume and if
	  so, go to the home folder, to make sure we don't display a probably
	  no longer existing mount point afterwards.

2006-03-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-exec.{c,h}: Add thunar_vfs_exec_sync() helper
	  function.

2006-03-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c(thunar_details_view_zoom_level_changed):
	  Fix bug in Gtk+ 2.6 version of this method.

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-path.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Add

	  which includes the last position of the gutter that separates the
	  side pane and the main view.
	* docs/README.thunarrc, thunar/thunar-preferences.c,
	  thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c: Add new preferences

	  thunar/thunar-tree-view.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am,
	  thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Initial import
	  of the tree side pane. Still missing a lot of features, but the basics
	  are in place and the performance and memory overhead is quite good
	  already. Bug #1363.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add new files.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Update german translations.

2006-03-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-util.c: Do not include
	  <libxfce4util/libxfce4util.h> directly.

	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_init): Always sort

	  thunar/Makefile.am: Import ThunarColumnModel and ThunarColumnEditor
	  classes. The ThunarColumnModel class handles the order, visibility and
	  fixed widths of columns. The ThunarColumnEditor class provides a
	  dialog to configure the ThunarColumnModel. Bug #1351.
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-details-view-ui.xml,
	  thunar/Makefile.am: Use column order and visibility from the
	  ThunarColumnOrder. Add "Configure Columns..." menu item to "View",
	  which pops up the ThunarColumnEditor. For fixed column mode, we use
	  the fixed height mode provided by GtkTreeView, which speeds up the
	  detailed list view a lot, esp. with older Pango version. Bug #1351.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add new files here.

	  leaving a directory and scroll to it when entering the directory
	  again.
	* thunar/thunar-application.{c,h}: Return the created window from the
	  thunar_application_open_window() method.
	* thunar/thunar-dbus-service-infos.xml, thunar/thunar-dbus-service.c:
	  Add DisplayFolderAndSelect() to the org.xfce.FileManager interface.
	  File managers that cannot scroll and select to a given file can
	  silently ignore the filename parameter and handle it like an
	  invocation of DisplayFolder(). Bug #1553.

2006-03-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c: Fix shortcut rename.

	  bold font for the titles.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Update po files.

	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}: Remember the scroll offset when
	  changing directory and apply saved scroll offset once a folder is
	  loaded again.

2006-02-27	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_common_prefix_append): Do
	  not append a slash for the current directory. Otherwise a slash will
	  automatically be appended while browsing folders under certain

	  want.

2006-02-27	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/main.c, thunar/thunar-application.{c,h},

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_drag_begin):
	  Release the drag path list, just in case drag_end() wasn't called

	  the bug yet).

	  Add "reload" button to the toolbar.
	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c, thunar/thunar-details-view.c: Use
	  ExoTreeView, which provides a tree view with single-click support.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: The internal
	  widgets now both provide the "single-click" property, so we can
	  connect it in the ThunarStandardView constructor.

	* configure.in.in: Bump soname.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}: Add working_directory parameter to

2006-02-24	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-model.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c:
	  Make sure the path is still valid when renaming. Update the shortcuts
	  rename to alter the mode of ThunarTextRenderer, rather than the
	  "editable" property, which is not valid for ThunarTextRenderer.

2006-02-24	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-location-bar.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-window.c,

	  Add single/double-click options to the preferences dialog.
	* thunar/thunar-pango-extensions.{c,h}: Add new helper function

	  controls whether the text renderer should highlight text using the
	  single underline attribute when a row/item is highlighted.
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Add

	* thunar/thunar-location-bar.{c.h}, thunar/thunar-window.c:
	  ThunarLocationBar derives from ThunarComponent now, so the location
	  bar widget is able to add its own custom actions to the ui manager.
	* thunar/thunar-location-entry.c: Implement ThunarComponent here.
	* thunar/Makefile.am, thunar/thunar-location-buttons-ui.xml,
	  thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c, thunar/thunar-location-button.c:
	  Let ThunarLocationButtons handle the menu for ThunarLocationButton
	  managed by it. Also add a accelerator <Alt>Down for "down-folder",

	* thunar/thunar-dbus-service-infos.xml, thunar/thunar-dbus-service.c:

2006-02-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* THANKS, thunar-uca/thunar-uca-editor.c: Apply patch provided by
	  Nick Schermer <nickschermer@gmail.com> to fix a crash in the

2006-02-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  thunar/thunar-location-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Derive from ThunarAbstractDialog,

	  keyboard shortcuts and people can customize these shortcuts using
	  the standard GtkBindingSet mechanism. Bug #1380.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Update translations.
	* po/de.po: "Gerät auswerfen" is probably not the best translation

2006-02-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_get_emblem_names): Use "cant-write"
	  emblem for non-writable files owned by the user, to make it obvious
	  why an application will not be able to save the file (unless the
	  application uses a write to temporary, rename, unlink temporary
	  procedure).
	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c(thunar_location_buttons_forall): Do
	  not include the slider buttons unless include_internals is TRUE.
	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c: Remove buttons from the path bar

2006-02-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-model.c: Include non-removable volumes in
	  the list of hidden volumes.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-hal.c: Determine the volumes from the
	  drives on startup, instead of FindDeviceByCapability(volume), as
	  that seems to be what GNOME does. Maybe one day, there'll be a
	  usable HAL documentation, and hardware will really just work.

2006-02-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in.in, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am,

	  volumes and do not open a file for volume shortcuts as that may
	  prevent the volume from being unmounted properly.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.c: Setup a watch cursor on the given
	  window when ejecting, mounting or unmounting a volume, so the user
	  gets some feedback during the time it takes to perform the operation.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add new file.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-02-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  Bug #1447.
	* thunar/thunar-folder.c, thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Use the newly

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_cmp): Remove the safety
	  checks here, showing up too high in the profiler stats, and invalid
	  arguments to this function will be detected earlier (for debug
	  builds).

2006-02-10	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/: Update thunar-vfs API docs.
	* thunar/thunar-throbber-fallback.png, thunar/thunar-throbber.c: Use
	  smaller throbber, so we don't increase the height of the menu bar.

2006-02-10	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-1.pc.in: Add gthread-2.0 to the dependencies.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.c(thunar_vfs_init): Make sure the GThread
	  system is initialized.
	* thunar/main.c(main): thunar_vfs_init() will initialize GThread.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-types.h: Add flag
	  THUNAR_VFS_FILE_FLAGS_HIDDEN, which tells whether a given file should
	  be considered hidden.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Use the THUNAR_VFS_FILE_FLAGS_HIDDEN flag
	  and implement thunar_file_is_hidden() as simple macro.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_statusbar_text): Fix
	  a typo in the multi-selection ngettext() call.
	* thunar/main.c(main): Call gdk_notify_startup_complete() if the remote
	  LaunchFiles() succeeds.

2006-02-10	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-text-renderer.c(thunar_text_renderer_set_widget): Use
	  the base text direction specified by Gtk+. Also, do not interpret
	  line separators in file names.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-listdir-job.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-marshal.list: Add boolean return value to the
	  ThunarVfsListdirJob::infos-ready signal, and allow handlers to take
	  over ownership of the infos list to avoid having to allocate a new
	  list (which reduces both performance overhead and the negative effects
	  on the data cache). Handlers must take care when using this feature,
	  documentation has been updated to explain the details.
	* thunar/thunar-folder.c: Take over ownership of the list provided by
	  "infos-ready" and just replace the ThunarVfsInfo's with ThunarFile's
	  for the initial load case. For the reload case, there's no real gain
	  in taking over ownership, so we keep the existing behaviour there.

2006-02-09	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunarx/thunarx-provider-factory.c: Initialize the factory on demand.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-scandir.c(thunar_vfs_scandir_collect_fast): Use
	  a larger buffer to speed up loading large directories.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c: Initialize the MIME desktop
	  stores on demand.

2006-02-09	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-file.h: Use cast checks instead of type checks here, as
	  they will be optimized away with regular builds. Debug builds will
	  still include the checks.
	* thunar/thunar-application.c, thunar/thunar-chooser-button.c,
	  thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-chooser-model.c,
	  thunar/thunar-clipboard-manager.c, thunar/thunar-create-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-emblem-chooser.c, thunar/thunar-file.c,
	  thunar/thunar-folder.c, thunar/thunar-gobject-extensions.h,
	  thunar/thunar-history.c, thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c,
	  thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-launcher.c, thunar/thunar-list-model.c,
	  thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c, thunar/thunar-location-entry.c,
	  thunar/thunar-path-entry.c, thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c,
	  thunar/thunar-progress-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-shortcuts-icon-renderer.c,
	  thunar/thunar-shortcuts-pane.c, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-statusbar.c, thunar/thunar-text-renderer.c,
	  thunar/thunar-throbber.c, thunar/thunar-window.c: We don't need
	  to implement G_OBJECT_WARN_INVALID_PROPERTY_ID() for regular builds,
	  as GObject will perform the required checks, but we need it for
	  debug builds to make sure the switch statement is complete.

2006-02-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-util.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Add
	  new function thunar_vfs_canonicalize_filename().
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-path.c(thunar_vfs_path_new): Use
	  thunar_vfs_canonicalize_filename() on absolute paths.
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/: Update the thunar-vfs API docs.
	* thunar/thunar-dialogs.{c,h}: Use a generic parent parameter instead of
	  a GtkWidget, so this method is also usable if no GtkWidget is none,
	  but the dialog must appear on a specific screen.
	* thunar/thunar-application.{c,h}: Add a "daemon" property, which
	  determines whether Thunar will exit once the last window is closed.
	  Remove the D-BUS service here. Add process_filenames() method, to
	  process the list of filenames given on the command line. Bug #1384.
	* thunar/main.c: Attach the D-BUS here.
	* Makefile.am, org.xfce.Thunar.service.in: Add Thunar specific service
	  file.
	* thunar/thunar-dbus-service-infos.xml, thunar/thunar-dbus-service.c:
	  Add the org.xfce.Thunar interface here, with currently only a
	  LaunchFiles() method, which can process Thunar command line parameters
	  in a remote instance. Bug #1384.
	* thunar/thunar-dbus-client.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am: Add convenience
	  wrapper for the D-BUS LaunchFiles() of the org.xfce.Thunar interface,
	  which is used on startup to first try to reuse an existing instance.
	  This way new folder windows will popup instantly if an instance of
	  Thunar is already running.
	* org.xfce.Thunar.service.in, org.xfce.FileManager.service.in,
	  thunar/main.c: Add --daemon option and use it when starting from the
	  message bus. Pass all additional parameters as file names to a run-
	  ning remote instance or to ThunarApplication as fallback. Bug #1384.
	* examples/xfce-file-manager.py, examples/Makefile.am: Add a simple
	  example how to communicate with the file manager using the D-BUS
	  Python bindings.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-02-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_action_about): Fix the copyright
	  date.

2006-02-07	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-application.{c,h}: Add thunar_application_take_window(),
	  which is used to add a GtkWindow to the internal application windows
	  list. The application will not exit until the last controlled window
	  is closed by the user.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Use a generic parent parameter for the
	  thunar_file_launch() method.
	* thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.{c,h}: Use a generic parent paramter for
	  the thunar_show_chooser_dialog() method, and let the application take
	  over control of the dialog window.
	* thunar/thunar-gdk-extensions.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am: Import method
	  thunar_gdk_screen_open() from Terminal, which opens a GdkScreen from
	  a full qualified display name.
	* README, configure.in.in: Add optional check for D-BUS.
	* thunar/Makefile.am, org.xfce.FileManager.service.in, Makefile.am,
	  thunar/thunar-dbus-service-infos.xml, thunar/thunar-application.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-dbus-service.{c,h}: Initial import of the basic D-BUS
	  service for Thunar, the org.xfce.FileManager implementation. See the
	  thunar-dbus-service-infos.xml file for a description of the current
	  interface.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Update the translations.

2006-02-07	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-cleaner.c: Also cleanup the defaults.list
	  file, replacing previously merged desktop-ids and dropping references
	  to no longer existing .desktop files.

2006-02-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-cleaner.c, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am,
	  configure.in.in: Add a simple utility program thunar-vfs-mime-cleaner,
	  which cleans up the user's $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications directory and
	  removes all automatically generated .desktop files (either generated
	  by Thunar or Nautilus) whose associated program is no longer installed
	  on the user's system. In addition, it tries to combine duplicated
	  .desktop whose Exec values are equal to further the reduce the
	  overhead.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c: Invoke thunar-vfs-mime-cleaner
	  every five minutes.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-*.h: Add
	  G_GNUC_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT to all methods, whose return value should
	  never be ignored. This should help to avoid memory leaks in the
	  future.

2006-02-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-chmod-job.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-chown-job.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-listdir-job.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-scandir.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-scandir.h, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-unlink-job.c: The directory scanning is now
	  cancelable. Bug #1239.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c: Properly reload/regenerate thumbnails
	  when image files are changed. Bug #1435.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.c
	  (thunar_vfs_mime_application_new_from_file): Check TryExec (or Exec)
	  first prior to allocating a ThunarVfsMimeApplication for a .desktop
	  file, whose associated program cannot be run. Bug #1436.

2006-02-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Autoscroll while dragging to a
	  ThunarStandardView widget. Bug #1304.

2006-02-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-templates-action.c: Use "show" instead of "map" to
	  create the Templates menu, to make sure the menu position is
	  determined properly.
	* README, configure.in.in, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Use cairo only
	  with Gtk+ >= 2.7.1.
	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c(thunar_shortcuts_view_init): Display
	  typeahead search for the shortcuts view.

2006-02-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.c(thunar_vfs_transfer_job_execute):
	  Try to use g_rename() first when moving files, and only fallback to
	  copy&delete if either the target exists (which requires user inter-
	  action to resolve the issue) or the rename didn't work, i.e. source
	  and target are not on the same filesystem. Bug #1229.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.{c,h}: Add thunar_vfs_volume_is_disc()
	  to allow applications to decide whether to eject or unmount a
	  volume.
	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c
	  (thunar_shortcuts_view_button_press_event): Use the newly added method
	  thunar_vfs_volume_is_disc() to determine whether to display Eject or
	  Unmount.
	* thunar/thunar-side-pane.{c,h}: Derive ThunarSidePane from
	  ThunarComponent instead of ThunarNavigator.
	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-window.c: Use the class name as name for the action
	  groups.
	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-pane-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-shortcuts-pane.c,
	  thunar/thunar-window.c, thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml,
	  thunar/Makefile.am: Add new action to add a folder (or a list of
	  folders, depending on the selection content) to the shortcuts pane.
	  Bug #1397.
	* thunar/thunar-throbber.c, thunar/thunar-throbber-fallback.{h,png},
	  thunar/Makefile.am: Use the "process-working" icon for the throbber,
	  as specified by the Icon Naming Specification, with an internal
	  fallback to a modified version of the Tango "process-working" icon.
	* configure.in.in, icons/Makefile.am, icons/scalable/,
	  icons/16x16/Thunar.png, icons/16x16/Thunar.png,
	  icons/24x24/Thunar.png, icons/48x48/Thunar.png: Revert to the previous
	  Thunar icon.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-02-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c(thunar_properties_dialog_update):
	  Use G_GINT64_FORMAT instead of "lld" as format for the file size.

2006-02-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* Thunar.desktop.in: Add "GTK" to the Categories.

2006-02-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c: Make sure to catch the tab key even for
	  the ThunarLocationEntry case. This doesn't work if the completion list
	  is visible, tho (Gtk+ bug/limitation). Bug #1346.

2006-02-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.{c,h}: Add a new convenience function
	  thunar_show_chooser_dialog().
	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c(thunar_launcher_open_files),
	  thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_launch): Use the new function
	  thunar_show_chooser_dialog() here.
	* thunar/thunar-gtk-extensions.{c,h}: Add a new convenience function
	  thunar_gtk_ui_manager_get_action_by_name(), which is unfortunately
	  missing from GtkUIManager.
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Use
	  thunar_gtk_ui_manager_get_action_by_name() to locate the launcher
	  actions in the UI manager.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add a new convenience function
	  thunar_file_list_get_applications(), which can be used to determine
	  the set of applications that can be used to open a given set of
	  files.
	* thunar-uca/thunar-uca-chooser.c(thunar_uca_chooser_delete_clicked):
	  Save the model after removing a custom action.
	* thunar/thunar-launcher.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-launcher-ui.xml, thunar/Makefile.am, 
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Replace the
	  previous ThunarLauncher class with a more advanced one, which has
	  access to the GtkUIManager. The new implementation also displays
	  which application will be used to open files, based on Jonathan
	  Blandfords suggestion for Nautilus. Bug #1428.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-action-private.h, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-action.{c,h},thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-handler-private.h, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.h,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-handler.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c: Import ThunarVfsMimeAction
	  class to support desktop actions in Thunar. The abstract base class
	  ThunarVfsMimeHandler is used to avoid duplicating the existing code
	  for ThunarVfsMimeApplication in ThunarVfsMimeAction, and it will also
	  make it easier to handle both ThunarVfsMimeApplication's and
	  ThunarVfsMimeAction's in the user interface code. Bug #1374.
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/: Update the Thunar-VFS API docs.
	* thunar/thunar-chooser-button.c, thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-chooser-model.c, thunar/thunar-file.c,
	  thunar/thunar-launcher.c: Update to the new ThunarVfsMimeHandler and
	  ThunarVfsMimeApplication interface.
	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c: Display desktop actions in the file context
	  menu and the "File" menu, based on the newly added ThunarVfsMimeAction
	  class. Bug #1375.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Update the file list.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Update german translations.
	* configure.in.in, icons/: Change the Thunar icon to the new one
	  provided by Young Hahn <youngjin.hahn@gmail.com>. Any artists around
	  to make it look even better?

2006-02-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c
	  (thunar_permissions_chooser_file_changed): Display the program check
	  box only for files which we will actually execute.
	* thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c: Add a warning text to the
	  permissions chooser for folders, whose exec and read flags are
	  inconsistent. Add a button to allow the user to fix the folder
	  permissions automatically if inconsistent.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-02-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add method thunar_file_list_to_path_list(),
	  which transforms a list of ThunarFile's to a list of ThunarVfsPath's.
	* thunar/thunar-clipboard-manager.c
	  (thunar_clipboard_manager_get_callback): Use newly added function
	  thunar_file_list_to_path_list() here.
	* thunarx/thunarx-file-info.c(thunarx_file_info_list_copy): Use a
	  slightly more efficient implementation here.
	* thunarx/thunarx-file-info.{c,h}, thunarx/thunarx.symbols: Add a boxed
	  type for a list of ThunarxFileInfo's.
	* docs/reference/thunarx/: Update the thunarx API docs.
	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c: Use the new boxed type for the list of
	  selected files, rather than a pointer.
	* thunar/thunar-navigator.c(thunar_navigator_get_type): Add requirement
	  on G_TYPE_OBJECT.
	* thunar/thunar-component.{c,h}: Add new interface ThunarComponent for
	  those parts of a ThunarWindow that require access to both the UI
	  manager and the currently selected files. ThunarComponent extends
	  ThunarNavigator.
	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: The ui-manager property is now in 
	  ThunarComponent and ThunarView inherits ThunarComponent.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}: Implement ThunarComponent interface
	  as required by ThunarView now. This way other components will be able
	  to determine the selected files and set the selected files without
	  having to interact with the ThunarView implementation directly.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c(thunar_vfs_info_get_free_space): Be sure
	  to use statvfs(2) for IRIX. Bug #1425.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.h(ThunarVfsVolumeManagerIface): Reserve
	  some space for future expansion now.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-*.c, docs/reference/thunar-vfs/: Some updates
	  to the Thunar-VFS API documentation.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Update translations.

2006-02-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_init): Update to the
	  new show-hidden settings name. Bug #1424.

2006-02-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Check for statvfs() and statfs(), and required
	  header files.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols:
	  Move the get_free_space() method from ThunarVfsVolume to ThunarVfsInfo
	  so we can use it even if no volume manager implementation is avail-
	  able for the target system. Bug #1420.
	* thunar/thunar-file.h: Add get_free_space() method to ThunarFile, so
	  we can easily determine the amount free space for a given volume
	  based on a file located on that volume. Bug #1421.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_statusbar_text): Use
	  new method thunar_file_get_free_space().
	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Display the amount of free space
	  on a certain volume in the properties dialog for folders.

2006-02-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-throbber.c: Fix typo in GDK_WINDOWING_X11. Cannot use
	  gdk_cairo_region() with GDK < 2.7.1.

2006-02-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.c(thunar_icon_renderer_render): Make it
	  easier to distinguish hidden and backup files from regular files.
	* docs/README.thunarrc, thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Rename the
	  DefaultShowHidden preference to LastShowHidden.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-window.c: Drop the
	  "Show hidden files" option from the preferences dialog. Instead Thunar
	  now preserves the users last selection. This way, the "Show hidden
	  files" behaviour is now consistent with the rest of the file manager.
	  Bug #1417.

2006-02-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-model.{c,h}: Drop obsolete method
	  thunar_shortcuts_model_file_for_iter() from ThunarShortcutsModel.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols:
	  Add eject(), mount() and unmount() methods to the ThunarVfsVolume
	  interface. The interface is therefore mostly done now, maybe some
	  small additions required for certain backends in the future. Bug #995.
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/: Update the API docs.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c: Implement eject(), mount() and
	  unmount() for the BSD backend.
	* thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c: Allow users to mount, unmount and
	  eject volumes using the shortcuts pane. Volumes will also be mounted
	  automatically if you select "Open", "Open in New Window" or just
	  double click them. But all this is currently only available to BSD
	  users.
	* docs/README.volumes: Add notes about the volume manager.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Another four strings translated!

2006-02-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_scroll_event):
	  Zoom-in on scroll down, zoom-out on scroll up, to be compatible with
	  Firefox.

2006-02-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Open a dialog when renaming a file.
	  Bug #1413.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_action_delete):
	  Use "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons in the delete confirmation dialog,
	  as suggested by Jasper.
	* thunar/thunar-progress-dialog.c(thunar_progress_dialog_error),
	  thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c
	  (thunar_permissions_chooser_job_error): Use "Close" button for the
	  error dialogs.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.
	* po/de.po: Some work on the german translations.
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/tmpl/: Update thunar-vfs API docs.

2006-02-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Don't recreate plugin pages if
	  the file changes, but instead let the plugins connect to the file's
	  "changed" signal and update their user interface appropriately.
	  Bug #1355.

2006-02-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunarx/thunarx-file-info.{c,h},
	  thunarx/thunarx.symbols: Move "changed" and "renamed" signals from
	  ThunarFile to ThunarxFileInfo, so plugins can use these signals to
	  stay informed about changes to files. First part of bug #1354.
	* docs/reference/thunarx/: Update the API documentation.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-types.h:
	  Drop the inode field from the ThunarVfsInfo struct, as we don't
	  need it anyway and it can cause trouble with systems where ino_t's
	  size depends on whether largefile support is active or not.

2006-02-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-scandir.c: Use g_access() if available.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c(_thunar_vfs_info_new_internal): Fix a
	  bug where the path name was g_free()'d for .desktop files with non
	  ASCII file names.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-path.c(thunar_vfs_path_to_string): Apply simple
	  optimization here: Prefer the stack memory over heap memory when
	  constructing the absolute path.

2006-02-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-util.c(thunar_vfs_humanize_size): Use "kB"

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Disable the "create-document" action
	  on non-writable folders.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-scandir.c: Return an error when trying to scan
	  a directory for which the user has no execute permissions. Bug #1408.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_get_emblem_names): Add "cant-read"
	  emblem to folders, where we don't have permissions to enter. Second
	  part of fix for bug #1408.

2006-01-31	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c: Treat .desktop files of Type=Link as
	  executable as well, and when requested to execute such a file, extract
	  the URL and pass it to exo-open for further processing. Bug #1369.

2006-01-31	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-exec.c(thunar_vfs_exec_parse): Use exo-open
	  instead of hardcoding Terminal as terminal emulator. Bug #1400.

2006-01-31	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Depend on exo 0.3.1.3.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-listdir-job.c: Make sure the list head always
	  points to a valid ThunarVfsInfo list, even if an error occurred while
	  stat()'ing files in a given directory. Bug #1390.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_action_about): Use the newly
	  added exo_url_about_dialog_hook() functions to open links in the
	  about dialog.

2006-01-31	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_scroll_event): Add
	  support to zoom in/out using Control+MouseWheel.

2006-01-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_action_open_templates): Improve
	  the text for the "About Templates" dialog. Thanks to Brian for the
	  suggestion. Bug #1392.

2006-01-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/Makefile.am, thunar/thunar-throbber.{c,h}: Import the
	  ThunarThrobber widget class, which display a loading animation
	  similar to the one found in Firefox.
	* thunar/thunar-statusbar.{c,h}: Drop the statusbar icon, as it's
	  confusing, since it refers to the current folder instead of the
	  selected items, but the text displayed in the statusbar refers to the
	  selected items.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Add a ThunarThrobber to the menu bar, and use
	  it to display loading animation instead of the statusbar icon.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Add additional reload shortcut GDK_F5.
	* docs/README.thunarrc, thunar/thunar-preferences.c,
	  thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: The statusbar
	  is optional now. Bug #1395.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-01-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add ru translations.

2006-01-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/README.thunarrc: Add missing preferences.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Rearrange stuff.

2006-01-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-enum-types.{c,h}: Add ThunarZoomLevel and ThunarIconSize
	  required for the zoom-level support.
	* docs/README.thunarrc, thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Changed property
	  ShortcutsIconSize to ThunarIconSize, required for the upcoming
	  changes to ThunarIconRenderer. People starting Thunar for the first
	  time after this upgrade will notice that the size of the shortcuts
	  icons is too small because of this change. Either edit thunarrc and
	  change ShortcutsIconSize appropriately or just remove thunarrc and
	  let Thunar recreate it with sane defaults (your settings will be lost
	  then). Add two new preferences LastDetailsViewZoomLevel and
	  LastIconViewZoomLevel.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.{c,h}: The size property is now of type
	  ThunarIconSize, rather than plain int.
	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: Add zoom control methods to the ThunarView
	  interface.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml,
	  thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-details-view.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Add support
	  for seven different zoom levels to Thunar based on the previous
	  changes. This fixes bug #1357, and thereby implements one of the most
	  oftenly requested features.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-01-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c: Add support to drop on pathbar
	  buttons, as requested in bug #1344.

2006-01-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_files_removed): Fix bug
	  where only the first file was removed.
	* thunar/thunar-folder.{c,h}: Add new method thunar_folder_reload(),
	  which explicitly forces the ThunarFolder to reload its contents.
	  This fixes bug #1360.
	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: Add new method thunar_view_reload() to the
	  ThunarView interface.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Implement thunar_view_reload() for the
	  ThunarStandardView class, using the newly added thunar_folder_reload()
	  method.
	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Add a "Reload"
	  item to the "View" menu, using "Ctrl+R" as accelerator to stay com-
	  patible with Firefox, Nautilus, etc. This fixes bug #1361.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c
	  (thunar_standard_view_drag_data_received): Reload the contents of the
	  target folder after a successful XDirectSave. This fixes bug #1362.
	* po/Thunar.pot, po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-01-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-templates-action.c: Add support for sub folders below
	  the ~/Templates folder. This fixes reopened bug #1391.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}: Add
	  thunar_vfs_info_read_link(), which determines the target from a
	  symbolic link.
	* thunar/thunar-file.h: Add method thunar_file_read_link() as wrapper
	  to thunar_vfs_info_read_link().
	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Display the "Link Target" for
	  symbolic links. This fixes bug #1394.

2006-01-28	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-chmod-job.c(thunar_vfs_chmod_job_execute),
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-chown-job.c(thunar_vfs_chown_job_execute):
	  Properly emit and release an error that occurred on the last file.
	* THANKS, thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c: Add support to open shortcuts
	  in new windows using the context menu or double-middle-clicks, based
	  on a patch by Laurent Meunier <meunier.laurent@laposte.net>. This
	  fixes bug #1381.
	* docs/README.thunarrc, thunar/thunar-preferences.c,
	  thunar/thunar-window.c: Remember the window dimensions whenever the
	  size of a window is changed and use the last saved window dimensions
	  for newly created windows. This fixes bug #1389.
	* thunar/thunar-pango-extensions.{c,h}: Add new helper function
	  thunar_pango_attr_list_big_bold(), which returns a pango attribute
	  list for big, bold text rendering.
	* thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c
	  (thunar_permissions_chooser_ask_recursive): Use big, bold label for
	  the dialog title to stay consistent with GtkMessageDialog.
	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-creat-job.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Add new
	  class ThunarVfsCreatJob, which is used to create empty files for a
	  given list of paths.
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/tmpl/thunar-vfs-operations.sgml,
	  docs/reference/thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-sections.txt: Update API docs.
	* thunar/thunar-application.{c,h}: Add thunar_application_creat() as
	  wrapper for the newly imported ThunarVfsCreatJob.
	* thunar/thunar-application.{c,h}: Add thunar_application_copy_to() to
	  copy files from one location to another, rather than copying files
	  from different sources to exactly one folder.
	* thunar/thunar-create-dialog.c(thunar_create_dialog_set_filename):
	  If the suggested file name contains a dot, pre-select only the text
	  up to the dot.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-templates-action.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am: Add support
	  for Templates in a way compatible with what Nautilus does currently.
	  This is part one of the fix for bug #1391.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences, docs/README.thunarrc: Add new property
	  "misc-show-about-templates", which determines whether the "About
	  Templates" dialog will be shown when entering the Templates folder.
	* icons/16x16/stock_thunar-templates.png, icons/16x16/Makefile.am,
	  thunar/thunar-stock.{c,h}: Add new stock icon "thunar-templates".
	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Add "Templates"
	  to the "Go" menu, which will open the ~/Templates folder (it will be
	  created on-demand) and popup a message describing the purpose of the
	  ~/Templates folder. This is part two of the fix for bug #1391.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add new files here.
	* po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-01-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-xfer.c: Apply
	  patch provided by Daichi to add several translator hints to
	  thunar-vfs.
	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c
	  (thunar_properties_dialog_key_press_event): Support Ctrl+W for clo-
	  sing the properties dialog, to be consistent with the main windows.

2006-01-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* THANKS, configure.in.in: Add nl to XDT_I18N(). Add translator credits
	  to THANKS.

2006-01-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-util.c(thunar_vfs_humanize_size): Use "GB"
	  instead of "G", "MB" instead of "M" and "KB" instead of "K", to
	  make it more obvious what the value means (this fixes bug #1367).

2006-01-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-chooser-model.c,
	  thunar/thunar-clipboard-manager.c, thunar/thunar-create-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-emblem-chooser.c, thunar/thunar-file.c,
	  thunar/thunar-folder.c, thunar/thunar-history.c,
	  thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-launcher.c, thunar/thunar-list-model.c,
	  thunar/thunar-navigator.c, thunar/thunar-open-with-action.c,
	  thunar/thunar-path-entry.c, thunar/thunar-progress-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-statusbar.c, thunar/thunar-text-renderer.c,
	  thunar/thunar-view.c, thunar/thunar-window.c: Remove various internal
	  strings from the list of translatable strings to reduce confusion
	  for translators.
	* po/*.po: Update translations.

2006-01-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-enum-types.{c,h}: Import enum types required for the
	  desktop background management.

2006-01-24	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c(thunar_preferences_set_property): No need
	  to call g_object_notify() here, as GObject does that automatically
	  whenever set_property() is being called.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Remove useless safetly checks in
	  get_property() and set_property(), since GObject already makes sure
	  that the property id is valid.

2006-01-23	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c(thunar_properties_dialog_update):
	  Display size only for regular files, as it's misleading for other
	  file system entities.
	* po/*.po: Merge new strings. Some work on the german translations,
	  we really need a german translator!

2006-01-23	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/README.thunarrc, thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Add new preferences

	  int transformations.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.{c,h},thunar/thunar-shortcuts-model.{c,h},

	  thunar/thunar-shortcuts-view.c: Import ThunarShortcutsIconRenderer
	  class, which is derived from ThunarIconRenderer and allows us to draw
	  icon cells consistently throughout the file manager. This also fixes
	  bug #1340, which requests to display emblems for the icons in the
	  shortcuts pane. Both the display of emblems in the shortcuts pane
	  and the size of the icons in the shortcuts pane are now configurable
	  through the thunarrc file (for the emblems, there's also a menu item
	  in the context menu).

2006-01-23	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Bump version to 0.2.1svn.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Make thunar_file_accepts_drop() easier to

	  gtk-doc remove it's empty line here, for whatever reason.

	* thunar/thunar-text-renderer.c(thunar_text_renderer_render): Render
	  focus indicator when following state. Part two of fix for bug #1321.

2006-01-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c, FAQ: Store preferences in an .ini file,
	  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Thunar/thunarrc, similar to what Terminal does, so
	  users can easily adjust hidden settings, and don't have to dive into
	  the details of managing a tdb database file.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-view.c, thunar/thunar-path-entry.c,
	  thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-preferences.c,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Rename "default-folders-first" to
	  "misc-folders-first" and "default-text-beside-icons" to
	  "misc-text-beside-icons", as those preferences aren't defaults.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_scroll_event),
	  thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Add a new hidden preference,
	  MiscHorizontalWheelNavigates, which controls whether the horizontal
	  mouse wheel should be used to navigate back and forth within a
	  Thunar view. This fixes bug #1319.
	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/README.thunarrc: Add brief overview of the
	  various Thunar configuration settings.

2006-01-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

2006-01-10	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.c(thunar_chooser_dialog_response): If
	  the default application was changed successfully, emit "changed" on
	  the file so everybody updates its state.
	* thunar/thunar-chooser-button.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c:
	  Import the ThunarChooserButton, which allows people to change the
	  default application from within the properties dialog.
	* po/POTFILES.in, po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-01-10	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_activate): If we have
	  a pending completion, accept the completion first, without activating
	  the entry. This makes it more consistent with the behaviour when
	  completing from the popup window.
	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_parse): Properly
	  transform all parts of the filename to the local encoding.
	* thunar/thunar-text-renderer.c(thunar_text_renderer_set_widget):
	  Calculate the approx. character dimensions based on the font metrics
	  for the active widget font.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_action_go_up): Handle errors
	  properly.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c:

	  Display only the name of the file in the dialog title.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Add support for the XDS protocol.
	* README: Add notes about supported standards.

2006-01-09	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-util.{c,h}: Add thunar_vfs_expand_filename(),
	  which is used to expand filenames that start with the tilde character.
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-sections.txt,
	  docs/reference/thunar-vfs/tmpl/thunar-vfs-util.sgml: Update
	  documentation.
	* thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c: Implement cancel-semantics for
	  the recursive permissions dialog.
	* thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.c: Add tooltips.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: Additional column to access the real
	  file name (in UTF-8 encoding).
	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.{c,h}: Add support for auto path completion.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add thunar_file_launch() to automatically
	  launch a given ThunarFile without having to manually figure out the
	  proper action.
	* thunar/thunar-location-entry.c, thunar/thunar-window.c: If the
	  ThunarPathEntry returns a non-directory file, just try to launch it.
	  This allows users to just open files right away from the path entry
	  without having to lookup the file in the icon/details view.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c, THANKS: Allow people to use the
	  horizontal mouse wheel to navigate back/forward. Based on a patch
	  provided by Danny Milosavljevic <danny.milo@gmx.net>.
	* po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2006-01-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.c
	  (thunar_vfs_monitor_queue_notification): Don't use strcmp() here, as
	  the notification's filename may be NULL.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Drop
	  thunar_vfs_info_chmod() and thunar_vfs_info_chgrp() again.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-chmod-job.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-chown-job.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Add
	  new classes ThunarVfsChmodJob and ThunarVfsChownJob as replacements
	  for the thunar_vfs_info_chmod() and thunar_vfs_info_chgrp() functions.
	  These jobs can operate recursively. Add interfaces to the new classes,
	  thunar_vfs_change_mode() and thunar_vfs_change_group().
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/: Update documentation.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Drop thunar_file_chmod(),thunar_file_chgrp()
	  and thunar_file_is_chgrpable(), as we'll use the asynchronous jobs
	  added to Thunar-VFS now.
	* thunar/thunar-advanced-permissions-dialog.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-change-group-dialog.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-permissions-model.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-permissions-view.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am,
	  thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Ditch the ACL aware permissions
	  user interface, as it's unlikely that ACL support will be there for
	  1.0 and so there's no need to reduce the usability of the permissions
	  user interface yet.
	* thunar/thunar-pango-extensions.{c,h}: Add new Pango helper method
	  thunar_pango_attr_list_small_italic().
	* thunar/thunar-enum-types.{c,h}: Import new files to contain enum
	  types that don't fit anywhere else and provide conversation functions
	  for these types.
	* thunar/thunar-permissions-chooser.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am,
	  thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Import simplified permissions
	  chooser, similar to the Aqua Finder one, with support to change
	  permissions recursively for folders.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Add
	  option "misc-recursive-permissions", which controls whether
	  permissions are always/never applied recursively, or whether Thunar
	  should ask the user everytime a permission flag is changed.

	  used within the icon view.

2006-01-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/Makefile.am, thunar/thunar-pango-extensions.{c,h}: Add common
	  PangoAttrList's here, to avoid allocating them over and over again,
	  and of course to avoid markup, which makes translator's life easier.
	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c, thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-progress-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c:
	  Use common PangoAttrList's provided by the thunar-pango-extensions.
	* thunar/thunar-permissions-view.c(thunar_permissions_view_init): Use
	  italic font for the warning to make it easier to distinguish the text
	  from the other parts of the GUI.
	* thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.c(thunar_chooser_dialog_update_header):
	  Also setup the window icon in addition to the header image icon.

2005-12-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Use -Wall -Werror for --enable-debug=yes as well.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_value): The MIME info
	  name is static.

	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-info.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-path.c,
	  thunar/main.c, thunar/thunar-file.c: Support four different levels
	  of debugging support. Default for SVN builds is `yes', while the
	  default for release builds is `minimum'. Closes bug #1254.

2005-12-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c(thunar_vfs_volume_bsd_update):
	  Specify correct buffer size for read().
	* thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c(thunar_icon_factory_load_from_file):
	  Don't add frames for small icon sizes (< 36). Be sure to scale icon
	  to the required size, so we don't need to scale on every render()
	  call.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.c(thunar_icon_renderer_init): Add 1px
	  padding to the icons.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.c(thunar_icon_renderer_render): Try to

2005-12-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-progress-dialog.c: Use Pango attribute list instead of

	* thunar/, po/POTFILES.in, po/*.po: Rename "Favourites" to "Shortcuts",
	  so we're consistent with the GtkFileChooser wording. This fixes bug
	  #1258.

2005-12-03	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-uca/thunar-uca-model.c(start_element_handler): Properly
	  truncate values.

2005-12-03	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Build the gnuc visibility test program with -Wall
	  -Werror, as gcc reports warnings instead of errors if ELF visibility
	  is not supported for the target platform. This fixes bug #1253.

2005-11-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-scandir.c: Workaround missing dirfd() definition
	  using the POSIX/XPG API on IRIX. This fixes bug #1247.

2005-11-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-dnd.c, thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-folder.c, thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Use exo_gtk_object_ref_sink() to
	  automatically handle floating references properly and avoid the use
	  of GTK_OBJECT_FLOATING (see GNOME bug #322853 for details). This fixes
	  bug #1249.

2005-11-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_renamed): Use

2005-11-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-thumbnail-generator.c
	  (thunar_thumbnail_generator_thread): Don't generate thumbnails for
	  files for which only the generator owns a reference.

2005-11-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c
	  (thunar_standard_view_merge_custom_actions): Fix typo.
	* thunarx/thunarx-private.{c,h}, thunarx/thunarx-menu-provider.c,
	  thunarx/Makefile.am, thunarx/thunarx-property-page-provider.c: Add
	  helper function thunarx_object_list_take_reference(), so we don't
	  need to repeat the same code again and again.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(action_entries): Add ... to the Preferences
	  action, since it opens a dialog. Use "e" as mnemonic, as "P" is
	  already used by "Paste".
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(action_entries): Add ... to the Select
	  by Pattern action, since it opens a dialog.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.c: Close preferences dialog on Esc
	  key press.
	* thunarx/thunarx-preferences-provider.{c,h}, thunarx/thunarx.h,
	  thunarx/thunarx.symbols, thunarx/Makefile.am: Add new interface
	  ThunarxPreferencesProvider, which can be implemented to add custom
	  actions to the preferences section of the "Edit" menu.
	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Query custom
	  preferences actions from the installed providers and add them to the
	  preferences section of the "Edit" menu. Actions are loaded in an idle
	  source to not delay folder loading when opening a new window, even if
	  a lot of preferences providers are installed.
	* docs/reference/thunarx/: Update the thunarx reference documentation.
	* thunar-uca/, configure.in.in, Makefile.am: Import the thunar-uca
	  module, which provides advanced users with an easy way to add custom
	  actions to Thunar's context menus. With this extension in place
	  there's no longer a need to add support G-Scripts (except maybe an
	  importer for thunar-uca).
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add new translatable files.
	* po/: Merge new strings.
	* examples/tex-open-terminal/README: Add note to use thunar-uca, and
	  consider the tex-open-terminal as example for extension writers.

2005-11-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-types.h: Add largefile support
	  for systems that don't support 64bit file offsets by default. This
	  fixes bug #1243.

2005-11-28	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c, thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c:
	  Use attribute lists instead of markup strings.

2005-11-27	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* tdb/Makefile.am: Fix make -j<N>.

2005-11-26	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c
	  (thunar_standard_view_merge_custom_actions): Don't sort custom actions
	  explicitly, but leave it up to the provider plugins to determine the
	  order of their actions. Also, be sure to update the UI manager after
	  unmerging the previously set menu actions, else GtkUIManager will
	  mess up the order of the actions.

2005-11-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunarx/thunarx-provider-factory.c: Make sure, ThunarxProviderModules
	  are never finalized, as GObject cannot unregister dynamic types (yet).
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_renamed): Properly
	  release the path returned from gtk_tree_row_reference_get_path().

2005-11-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/*.{c,h}, thunar/*.c, thunarx/*.c: Avoid duplicating static
	  strings if possible.

	  EACCES and EPERM on subdirectories with recursive scanning.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.h(ThunarVfsInfo): Compress "type", "mode"
	  and "flags" to reduce memory overhead.

2005-11-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add fr and pt_BR to gettext linguas, which were
	  previously imported by Daichi.

2005-11-21	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.h: Small
	  documentation tweaks.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.h: Allow previous declarations of the
	  ThunarVfsInfo typedef.
	* thunarx/thunarx-file-info.{c,h}, thunarx/thunarx.symbols,
	  thunar/thunar-file.c, docs/reference/thunarx/: Add new virtual method
	  thunarx_file_info_get_vfs_info(), which can be used to query the
	  ThunarVfsInfo for a given ThunarxFileInfo.

2005-11-21	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunarx/thunarx-provider-plugin.{c,h}, thunarx/Makefile.am,
	  thunarx/thunarx.h, thunarx/thunarx.symbols: Add ThunarxProviderPlugin
	  interface, which abstracts from the details of the dynamic type
	  registration, and is accessible to the extensions.
	* thunarx/thunarx-provider-module.{c,h}, thunarx/Makefile.am: Add
	  implementation for the ThunarxProviderPlugin interface, based on
	  GTypeModule, which is used on the file manager's side to manage the
	  type plugins.
	* thunarx/thunarx-provider-factory.{c,h}, thunarx/Makefile.am,
	  thunarx/thunarx.h, thunarx/thunarx.symbols: Add ThunarxProviderFactory
	  based on the ThunarExtensionManager as public interface to the
	  provider plugin mechanism. This may also be used by other applications
	  in the future.
	* thunarx/thunarx.h: Provide convenience macros ala G_DEFINE_TYPE() to
	  ease type registration for plugin writers.
	* examples/, configure.in.in: Update the "Open Terminal Here" example.
	* docs/reference/thunarx/: Update the thunarx reference manual to
	  include the new classes and interfaces.
	* thunar/thunar-extension-manager.{c,h}: Drop the old extension manager
	  class in favour of the new provider factory class.
	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Use
	  ThunarxProviderFactory to load the providers from the installed
	  extensions.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Update with new file list.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Implement thunar_file_list_copy() using
	  thunarx_file_info_list_copy() and thunar_file_list_free() using
	  thunarx_file_info_list_free().
	* docs/reference/thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-overrides.txt,
	  docs/reference/thunarx/thunarx-overrides.txt: Fix build error with
	  older gtk-doc versions.

2005-11-16	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Drop obsolete error class
	  ThunarVfsMimeApplicationError.

2005-11-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-gtk-extensions.{c,h}: Add new convenience function
	  thunar_gtk_action_group_create_tool_item(), which creates a new
	  GtkToolItem proxy for a given GtkAction in a GtkActionGroup.
	* thunar/thunar-location-bar.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-location-entry.c,
	  thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c: Add new virtual method
	  thunar_location_bar_is_standalone(), which determines whether a
	  given location bar should be displayed in a standalone fashion, or
	  embedded within a location toolbar.
	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Check whether
	  the location should be embedded into a location toolbar and if so,
	  generate a toolbar for it on-demand and place it below the menubar.
	  Else, the location bar is placed right above the view pane. This
	  gives a better appearance when using the location entry implementation
	  with a toolbar, and you don't need the toolbar with the pathbar
	  anyways.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add thunar-preferences-dialog.c here.
	* po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2005-11-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Use "b" as mnemonic for the "Select by
	  Pattern" action to avoid clash with "Preferences".
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Add "default-folders-first" property,
	  which determines whether folders should be sorted before other files.
	  Add "default-view", which dictates the default view pane used for new
	  windows, or "void" to use the view remembered in "last-view".
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}: Connect the list models
	  "folders-first" property to the "default-folders-first" preference.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_init): Check "default-view" first
	  and if it does not contain a valid view class name, check "last-view".
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c(thunar_details_view_get_accessible),
	  thunar/thunar-icon-view.c(thunar_icon_view_get_accessible): Set ATK
	  role for our folder views to ATK_ROLE_DIRECTORY_PANE.
	* thunar/Makefile.am, thunar/thunar-preferences-dialog.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Import class
	  ThunarPreferencesDialog, which allows the user to customize the global
	  preferences for Thunar. Add a "Preferences" menu item to the "Edit"
	  menu of ThunarWindow's.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Add "default-text-beside-icons" property,
	  which tells whether the icon view should display the file names beside
	  the file icons, rather than below the file icons.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Add a property "text-beside-icons", which
	  tells whether the icon view will place the icon captions beside the
	  icons rather than below. Synchronize the property with the global
	  option "default-text-beside-icons".
	* po/*.po: Merge new strings.

2005-11-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-xfer.c: Return G_FILE_ERROR_INTR when the copy
	  operation is explicitly cancelled by the user.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.c
	  (thunar_vfs_transfer_job_copy_pair): Don't delete the source file when
	  moving unless the target file was written successfully and the job
	  wasn't cancelled. This fixes a bug reported by Jari Rahkonen.

2005-11-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}: Register "Delete" as key binding
	  for the ThunarStandardView class, rather than registering it as
	  accelerator for the "delete" action. This fixes bug #1226.
	* thunar/thunar-marshal.list: Add BOOLEAN:VOID marshaller.

2005-11-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-exec.c(thunar_vfs_exec_on_screen): Fix invalid

	  dependencies.

2005-11-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Don't need to remember the "changed"
	  signal handler id per row, as g_signal_handlers_disconnect_matched()
	  using G_SIGNAL_MATCH_ID and G_SIGNAL_MATCH_CLOSURE is nearly as fast
	  as g_signal_handler_disconnect().
	* thunar/thunar-folder.c(thunar_folder_finalize): Specify both
	  G_SIGNAL_MATCH_ID and G_SIGNAL_MATCH_CLOSURE when disconnecting
	  "destroy" signals from files.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c, thunar/thunar-window.c: Remember the last
	  active view as default for now.
	* thunar/thunar-create-dialog.c(thunar_create_dialog_text_changed): Use
	  G_IS_DIR_SEPARATOR() rather than hardcoding the slash character.

2005-11-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* FAQ, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Add initial support for mouse gestures
	  to the icon view component.

2005-11-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c, thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Rename
	  "window-location-bar" to "last-location-bar" and "window-side-pane"
	  to "last-side-pane" to make clear that it's the last selected
	  setting.
	* thunar/thunar-metafile.h: Drop THUNAR_METAFILE_KEY_SHOWHIDDEN.
	* thunar/Makefile.am, thunar/thunar-gobject-extensions.{c,h}: Add
	  additional GValue transformation functions.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Register additional transformation
	  functions provided by the GObject extensions in the class_init()
	  function. Add new preference "default-show-hidden", which tells
	  whether hidden files are shown by default in new windows.
	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: Add the "show-hidden" property to the
	  ThunarView interface.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c:
	  Implement the "show-hidden" property from the ThunarView interface,
	  rather than adding an action to the UI manager.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Add "default-show-hidden" property, which
	  tells whether hidden files should be shown in newly opened windows.
	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Add the
	  "show-hidden" action here, which starts with the default value queried
	  from the preferences, and uses the new ThunarView API to sync the
	  selected setting.

2005-11-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c(thunar_preferences_set_property): No need
	  to call g_object_notify() here, as object_set_property() does that
	  implictly once the set_property() call returns.

2005-11-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-metafile.{c,h}: Remove the
	  default value handling from the ThunarMetafile class and leave it up
	  to the caller to specify the default value when fetching/storing
	  metadata.
	* thunar/thunar-folder.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Remove
	  the error parameter from the thunar_folder_get_for_file() method, as
	  this call cannot fail. If a loading error occurs, it will be reported
	  asynchronously by the listdir job.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c(thunar_preferences_set_property): Issue
	  a warning if a required transformation function is not available to
	  the GLib Type System, as this is effectively a bug in our application.

2005-11-12	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-folder.c, thunar/thunar-list-model.c,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Forward ThunarVfsListdirJob loading
	  errors to the ThunarStandardView and display an error dialog to the
	  user.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c, FAQ: Use a tdb database to store the
	  preferences, while not saving defaults to the database file.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.c: Add initial preferences
	  "window-location-bar" and "window-side-pane".
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Always remember the last selected location
	  bar and side pane setting in the preferences.

2005-11-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_statusbar_text):
	  Display symbolic links properly just like the MIME type field in
	  the properties dialog.

2005-11-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  This will increase the chance that Thunar will be ready for the Xfce
	  4.4.0 release.
	* thunar/*.[ch], thunar/Makefile.am: Use ThunarVfsPath instead of
	  ThunarVfsURI.
	* tests/test-thunar-vfs-path.c, tests/test-thunar-vfs-uri.c,
	  tests/Makefile.am: Replace the ThunarVfsURI test case with a new
	  ThunarVfsPath test case.
	* tests/test-thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c: Properly initialize and shutdown
	  the Thunar-VFS library.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Update the file list.
	* docs/: Sync the documentation with the changes.
	* configure.in.in: Don't use -fvisibility=hidden as that causes trouble
	  with inline functions that are also implemented and exported by the
	  library. Instead we explicitly mark internal functions with
	  G_GNUC_INTERNAL.

2005-10-03	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* THANKS, configure.in.in, po/es.po: Add spanish translations, thanks

2005-10-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.c: Fire notifications asynchronously, so
	  events can be injected from threads other than the main thread. This

	  Trash Bin action for the trash file).
	* thunar/thunar-application.{c,h}: Add thunar_application_delete_uris()
	  to be able to easily delete arbitrary files.
	* thunar/thunar-trash-file.c(thunar_trash_file_new): Use

	  the compiler supports the -fno-strict-aliasing switch.
	* po/*.po: Update translations.
	* main.c(main): Initialize file properly.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_local_file_is_renameable): Don't permit
	  users to rename root nodes.
	* thunar/thunar-open-with-action.c(thunar_open_with_action_menu_mapped):
	  Use "Other Application..." instead of just "Other...".

2005-09-23	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c(thunar_details_view_button_press_event),
	  thunar/thunar-icon-view.c(thunar_icon_view_button_press_event): Open
	  folders in new windows on double middle-click events.

2005-09-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Fix typo.

2005-09-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-*.c: Documentation tweaks.
	* configure.in.in, docs/reference/Makefile.am,
	  docs/reference/thunar-vfs/: Prepare Thunar-VFS reference manual.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_statusbar_text):
	  Use ngettext() for the statusbar text.
	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c(thunar_launcher_update): Use ngettext() for
	  the "Open in n New Windows" menu label.
	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c(thunar_launcher_open_new_windows): Use

	* po/*.po: Update po files.
	* configure.in.in, examples/open-terminal-here/Makefile.am,
	  thunar-vfs/Makefile.am, thunar/Makefile.am, thunarx/Makefile.am:
	  Don't add debugging and visibility flags to CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and
	  LDFLAGS, but use PLATFORM_CFLAGS, PLATFORM_CPPFLAGS and
	  PLATFORM_LDFLAGS instead to avoid trouble with certain conftests
	  when checking the distribution.

2005-09-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-trash.h: Fix typo.
	* thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.c(thunar_chooser_dialog_response): Handle
	  absolute paths properly for custom commands.

2005-09-20	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Load the supported mime types for the
	  applications.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Add a new constructor

	  (thunar_vfs_mime_application_equal): Properly initialize the
	  application variables.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.c
	  (thunar_vfs_mime_application_lookup_icon_name): Permit applications
	  to specify absolute paths for the icon name.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Extend the mime database by a new
	  method thunar_vfs_mime_database_set_default_application(), which is
	  used to set the default application for a given mime type.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-sysdep.c(_thunar_vfs_sysdep_parse_exec): Fix
	  typo to properly execute applications that require a terminal.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c

	  default applications for the given mime info to the list returned
	  from this method.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c(thunar_favourites_model_save): Use
	  g_mkstemp() to create the temporary file.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Add public flags to the mime
	  applications.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.c
	  (thunar_vfs_mime_application_new_from_file): Strip off known suffixes
	  for image files if a themed icon is specified. This way we can
	  work-around quite a few broken .desktop files.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Support the addition of custom
	  applications using thunar_vfs_mime_database_add_application() in
	  a way compatible to what Nautilus does (which is actually quite a
	  mess).
	* thunar/thunar-chooser-dialog.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-chooser-model.{c,h},
	  thunar/Makefile.am: Import the "Open With" dialog based on the two
	  classes ThunarChooserDialog and ThunarChooserModel, which in turn are
	  based on the new functionality provided by Thunar-VFS, and thereby
	  permit the user to associate applications with files (actually mime
	  types) and add new applications.
	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c: Connect the "Open With Other" action to
	  the new ThunarChooserDialog.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c: Document the drag source functions.
	* README: Add a list of dependencies for Thunar.
	* TODO: Drop completed items.

2005-09-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c: Include exo/exo.h.

2005-09-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-sysv.c: Include thunar-vfs-alias.h.

2005-09-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-progress-dialog.c: Use GObject for the job instead of
	  ExoObject.

2005-09-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-interactive-job.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-job.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-listdir-job.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-unlink-job.{c,h}: Allocate a new main loop for
	  every running job so we can terminate them properly and be sure to
	  run the finalize method in the main thread. This enables us to use
	  arbitrary GObjects within a job without having to worry about the
	  reference counting problem in GLib 2.6. The jobs are GObjects as well
	  now to easily support language bindings and allow us to drop the
	  problematic ExoObject class.

2005-09-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c(thunar_launcher_open_files): Use
	  g_object_unref() instead of exo_object_unref().

2005-09-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  a boxed type.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Apply Daichis patch to make the dynamic
	  actions titles translatable (#1153).

2005-09-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-info.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Turn ThunarVfsMimeInfo into a boxed
	  type.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-provider.c: No need to provide fallback
	  implementations for the virtual methods, as both providers implement
	  all virtual methods.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-provider.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-cache.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-legacy.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c: Derive the MIME providers from
	  GObject instead of ExoObject.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.c,

	  thunar/thunar-open-with-action.c, thunar/thunar-trash-folder.c:
	  Derive ThunarVfsMimeDatabase from GObject instead of ExoObject.

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-sysdep.h: Add inline atomic operations.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-listdir-job.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-sysdep.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-trash.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.c,

	  thunar/thunar-statusbar.c, thunar/thunar-trash-file.c, 
	  thunar/thunar-trash-folder.c: Turn ThunarVfsURI into a boxed type
	  to make language bindings easier and reduce the overhead. Drop the
	  foreign host support code, as we can't use it anyways, since nearly
	  every other existing application that handles file URIs is broken
	  when it comes to file URIs with authorities. Simplify the
	  thunar_vfs_uri_to_string() method again and return only escaped
	  versions of the URI.
	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_set_current_file):
	  Display file URIs for non-UTF8 paths.
	* tests/test-thunar-vfs-uri.c, tests/test-thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c:
	  Update the tests.
	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.h,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-types.h: Move the system-dependent types to
	  thunar-vfs-types.h.

	* thunar/thunar-extension-manager.c(thunar_extension_class_init):
	  Properly initialize the parent class reference.
	* examples/open-terminal-here/Makefile.am: Don't specify CLEANFILES
	  explicitly.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_get_mime_info): Documentation fix.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-database.c
	  (thunar_vfs_mime_database_get_info_for_file): When generating an
	  application/x-extension-<EXT> mime type and no valid extension is
	  found for the file name, fallback to the whole filename as suggested
	  by jrb. This way we can make sure that we will never return
	  application/octet-stream from this method and thereby allow the
	  program chooser to set default applications for every mime type
	  used in the file manager.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add $(top_builddir) to INCLUDES.

2005-09-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  the thunar namespace.

	  example.

	  "row-deleted" signals when changing folders unless somebody
	  is actually interested in these signals.

	  specify the correct path when deleting the previous items from the
	  model.
	* thunar/thunar-local-folder.c(thunar_local_folder_file_destroy): No
	  need to request a new list from GLib here.
	* thunar/thunar-local-folder.c(thunar_local_folder_infos_ready): Don't
	  add new files to two lists. Instead add them to one temporary list
	  and append the temporary list to the internal list later.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c(thunar_local_file_get_for_info): Fix an
	  invalid instance cast check.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c: Manage the file cache directly without using
	  weak references to avoid problems and save memory (weak references
	  are allocated in the GObject dataset).

2005-09-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Store the VFS monitor handle in the
	  GObject dataset as it's used only for explicit file monitoring (e.g.
	  for the properties dialog).
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_iter): Skip every
	  second comparison for iter lookups.

2005-09-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c: Invoke the parent's finalize method, as
	  that will be required for language bindings once we have weak/toggle
	  references for ExoObject.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c(thunar_local_file_rename): Re-register with
	  the VFS monitor if the rename succeeds.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c(thunar_vfs_uri_hash): Don't hash the
	  hostname if it's NULL.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c(thunar_vfs_uri_equal): We don't need to
	  query the hostname string here, as local files will always have host
	  set to NULL.
	* tests/test-thunar-vfs-uri.c(main): Extend the ThunarVfsURI test.
	* pixmaps/, Makefile.am, configure.in.in, thunar/thunar-window.c,
	  thunar/Makefile.am: Initial idea for the about dialog logo.

2005-09-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-listdir-job.c:
	  Use GList instead of GSList to manage ThunarVfsInfo lists, which
	  increases data locality and decreases memory usage (as there's no
	  need to keep another allocator around any more).
	* thunar/thunar-computer-folder.c, thunar/thunar-folder.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-list-model.c, thunar/thunar-local-folder.c,

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: No need to implement GtkTreeDragDest,
	  as that's handled in ThunarStandardView.

2005-09-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-launcher.c, thunar/thunar-list-model.c,
	  thunar/thunar-open-with-action.c, thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c:
	  We don't need to check the result of thunar_file_get_mime_info() any
	  more as it's garantied to be a valid ThunarVfsMimeInfo.

2005-09-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-computer-folder.c, thunar/thunar-file.c,
	  thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Always return a valid ThunarVfsMimeInfo

2005-09-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c(escape): Also escape '&' in URIs.

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-thumb.{c,h}: Implement the store thumbnail
	  functionality.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-sysdep.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-trash.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols,
	  thunar/thunar-clipboard-manager.c, thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c,
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c, thunar/thunar-file.c,
	  thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c, thunar/thunar-path-entry.c,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.c, thunar/thunar-statusbar.c: Improve
	  the thunar_vfs_uri_to_string() method to support UTF-8 URI strings
	  and escaping of URIs, which is required for proper Drag'n'Drop
	  interaction with other applications.

2005-09-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Store the watch count in the GObject data
	  list, as it seldomly used.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_load_icon): Try to load the "loading"
	  icon directly instead of checking the icon theme first.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Revert the "num-files" special handling
	  as it leads to a bug where the actions aren't updated properly when
	  changing directories.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-sysdep.h: Fix typo.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.c,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-unlink-job.c: Unlink thumbnails after removing
	  a file to reduce the junk in ~/.thumbnails/.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c(thunar_vfs_uri_get_md5sum): Escape the
	  path properly, so the thumbnail paths we determine are equal to those
	  of other file managers.

2005-09-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add the thumbnail frame source image to the
	  distribution.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c: Add some more cleverness in determining
	  whether or not to add a frame to a thumbnail.

	  Remove obsolete code.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c
	  (thunar_standard_view_button_release_event): Don't popup the context
	  menu using the just released button, as that would render the items
	  unclickable.

2005-09-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Avoid going through the selection
	  changed handling whenever the number of files in a model changes,

	  support to load icons from absolute paths.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c(thunar_local_file_get_icon_name): Allow the

	  instead of themed icon names.
	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c(thunar_location_buttons_make_button):
	  Don't permit location buttons to grab the focus.

2005-09-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  drag-data-delete handler of ExoIconView/GtkTreeView.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-view.c(thunar_icon_view_get_path_at_pos): The
	  exo_icon_view_get_path_at_pos() method really accepts widget
	  coordinates now, like GtkTreeView does, so we don't need to translate
	  the widget coordinates to icon window coordinates first.

	  thunar/thunar-trash-folder.c, thunar/thunar-window.c: Add an icon
	  state parameter to the ThunarFile icon loader, which allows to grab
	  icons for a certain state from a given file.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c: Drop the cached icon, as the ThunarIconFactory
	  does this pretty well already and we don't need to keep an additional
	  cached version of every file's icon.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.c, thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Use the
	  drop icon for the views while dragging over an item/row in the view.

2005-09-01	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-listdir-job.c: Fix the pre-sorting of files, so
	  upper layers always receive the info list sorted by name.
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c(thunar_details_view_button_press_event),
	  thunar/thunar-icon-view.c(thunar_icon_view_button_press_event): Don't
	  popup the context menu immediately on right-clicks, but schedule the
	  menu popup using thunar_standard_view_queue_popup().
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}: Add the ability to start a drag
	  operation using the right mouse button.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add virtual method accepts_uri_drop() and
	  method thunar_file_accepts_uri_drop(), which are used to determine
	  whether it is possible to drop a certain list of ThunarVfsURIs on
	  a given ThunarFile (using a set of actions specified by the drag
	  source).
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Implement the accepts_uri_drop() method
	  for local file handling.
	* thunar/thunar-progress-dialog.c(thunar_progress_dialog_ask),

2005-08-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c: Drop the icon caching from the
	  favourites model as it causes trouble with icon theme changing and
	  is unnecessary since the ThunarIconFactory already performs quite
	  well at caching icons.
	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c: Reload the icons for the location
	  buttons when the active icon/gtk theme is changed.

2005-08-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c(thunar_local_folder_infos_ready): Do not
	  compare the newly inserted files, as they are garantied to be
	  different from each other.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.c(thunar_vfs_info_matches): Move the URI
	  comparison to the end as that takes most of the time.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-listdir-job.c(thunar_vfs_listdir_job_execute):
	  Pre-sort the names in ascending order to get faster inserts for the
	  usual case where the user sorts its views by name.

	  ThunarFile implementations that provide the thunar_file_rename()
	  method.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Add support to rename local files based
	  on thunar_vfs_info_rename().
	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.c: Allow users to rename files using
	  the name entry widget.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_file_changed): Re-sort
	  the model as the file may have changed its name.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_sort): Avoid the GArray
	  overhead and try to use stack memory if possible.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.h, thunar/thunar-details-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Add virtual methods set_cursor() and
	  scroll_to_path() to the ThunarStandardView class and implement them
	  in ThunarDetailsView and ThunarIconView.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Implement the "Rename" action based
	  on the inline editing capabilities of ThunarTextRenderer.

2005-08-30	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}: Turn the name cell renderer into

	  ThunarListModel.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_class_init): Use
	  EXO_PARAM_* macros rather than G_PARAM_*.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c(thunar_vfs_uri_equal): Add a check to

	  a buffer of 512 bytes for the URI list string representation.

	  thunar_vfs_mime_info_get() and thunar_vfs_mime_info_get_for_file()

	  (thunar_vfs_mime_database_get_infos_for_info_locked): Be sure to
	  always unalias MIME-types prior to returning them from the mime
	  database instance. This way we don't need to care for unaliasing

	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.symbols: Add new method

	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Use the new hints to display appropriate
	  names and icons for .desktop files.

2005-08-27	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-trash.c: Use ThunarVfsMonitor instead of
	  polling the trash files/ directories manually.

2005-08-27	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.c, thunar/thunar-standard-view.h: Add
	  drag source support to the standard views.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Don't implement GtkTreeDragSource, as

2005-08-20	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-job.c(thunar_vfs_job_emit): Use G_VA_COPY to

	  the emblem placement and drawing code to work-around issues with
	  most icon themes, that don't provide emblems in the appropriate
	  sizes.

2005-08-19	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-statusbar.c: Drop the dependency on X11.
	* thunar/thunar-desktop-window.c: Include <gdk/gdkx.h> explicitly (since

2005-08-18	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunarx/thunarx-gdk-pixbuf-extensions.{c,h}: Add new function
	  thunarx_gdk_pixbuf_spotlight(), which is used to create a
	  special icon for the Gtk prelight state.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-renderer.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am,
	  thunar/thunar-details-view.c, po/POTFILES.in: Rename

	  thunar/thunar-details-view.c, po/POTFILES.in: Rename
	  ThunarDetailsViewTextRenderer to ThunarTextRenderer,

	  Add required functionality to use these renderers with the new
	  ExoIconView.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Update to use the new ExoIconView class,

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_files_added): Speed up

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: The memory chunk used for the rows is
	  now an object attribute, rather than a global variable.

2005-08-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-mime-application.c
	  (thunar_vfs_mime_application_new_from_desktop_id): Use "Name" instead
	  of "GenericName" for the application's name, as the "Name" usually
	  includes the project name in addition to the functional description
	  of the application, which provides better results than having several
	  applications named "Text Editor", etc.
	* configure.in.in: Prefer Gamin over FAM to avoid the C++ dependency
	  if possible. Besides that, Gamin offers several other advantages over
	  FAM, which makes it better suitable to be used in Thunar.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add missing source files here, and remove obsolete
	  files.
	* Thunar.desktop.in, Makefile.am, configure.in.in, po/POTFILES.in: Add

	  thunar/thunar-progress-dialog.c: Use ExoObject as base class for
	  ThunarVfsJob, ThunarVfsMimeInfo and ThunarVfsUri, which were fun-
	  damental types previously. ExoObject does exactly what we need
	  here, without any additional overhead. In particular, the ref-

	  the number of preallocated rows.
	* po/, Makefile.am, configure.in.in: Add i18n support.

	* thunar/thunar-details-view-text-renderer.c: Calculating the approxi-
	  mate sizes based on the font metrics requires way too much additional
	  data memory (because Pango loads the whole fontset for this calcu-

	  buttons.

2005-07-31	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.c: Include <time.h> since we
	  use the time() library call. g_chmod() will be introduced with GLib

	* thunar/thunar-clipboard-manager.c
	  (thunar_clipboard_manager_contents_received): Properly clear the

	  an "owner-changed" after a successfully initiating the paste operation
	  if either the Xserver or the GTK+ version doesn't support the XFixes
	  extension.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-transfer-job.c, configure.in.in: Add work-around
	  for systems that lack the lchmod() system call.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}: Query all actions from the group

	  disable all kinds of debugging support, and thereby may speed up
	  the whole application in certain cases.

	  interface.
	* thunar/thunar-statusbar.{c,h}: Add a "loading" indicator to the
	  statusbar. Add support to dnd from the shortcut indicator to the
	  favourites list.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_init): Connect the statusbar as
	  a navigator. Forward the "loading" property from the view to the

	* configure.in.in: Check for additional headers. Add optional
	  dependency on cairo.

2005-07-20	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-job-listdir.c(thunar_vfs_job_listdir_execute):
	  Always ignore the "." and ".." entries for directories.
	* thunar/thunar-location-bar.{c,h}: Add virtual method accept_focus(),
	  which tries to transfer keyboard focus to the location bar if it

	  Implement the accept_focus() method on the ThunarLocationBar
	  interface appropriately.
	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Make the
	  location bar configurable using the action system.

2005-07-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c: Do not handle the focus-out-event here,
	  as it's better to handle it in the upper layers.
	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.c(thunar_path_entry_set_current_file): Set
	  the cursor to the end and queue a redraw on the whole widget.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Include <thunar/thunar-location-entry.h>.

2005-07-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-path-entry.{c,h}: Add ThunarPathEntry class, which
	  implements a widget to which the user can enter paths. The auto

	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window.c: Add "Open
	  Location" action to the window, which will bring up a
	  ThunarLocationDialog.

2005-07-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Use "thunar-threaded" instead of "Thunar-threaded".
	* tests/test-thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c(main): Get this test working again.

2005-07-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* TODO: Add note to based the ThunarVfsJob communication on the GSignal
	  mechanism.
	* configure.in.in: Set tarname to be "Thunar-threaded".
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}: Let thunar_vfs_info_list_free()
	  return NULL.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-job-listdir.c: Invoke the callback every two
	  seconds, so for large directories, the user does not need to wait for
	  the whole folder to be loaded. Also sort the item names prior to
	  loading the infos.
	* thunar/thunar-local-folder.c: Support partial loading, as implemented
	  for ThunarVfsJobListdir.

2005-07-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-sysv.c: Fix compile warning with wrong
	  parameters to thunar_vfs_volume_manager_sysv_get_volume_by_info().
	  This fixes bug #1083.

	* thunar-vfs/xdgmime/: Import the XDG mime implementation with the
	  patches from libexo.
	* thunar-vfs/: The ThunarVfsInfo framework is now thread-safe, using
	  the ThunarVfsMime framework provided by ThunarVFS.
	* thunar/: Turn Thunar into a threaded application.

2005-07-16	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-folder.{c,h}: Add a "files-removed" signal, which can
	  be used by ThunarFolder implementation to solve the reload problem,
	  and probably other problems as well (like asynchronous loading).
	* thunar/thunar-local-folder.c(thunar_local_folder_rescan): Use
	  "files-removed" instead of destroying the no longer present files,
	  so we don't accidently terminate other stuff here.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Handle the "files-removed" signal of the
	  ThunarFolder.

2005-07-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c: Unselect all selected items if the
	  user clicks on an empty area of the treeview and neither Control
	  nor Shift is active.
	* thunar/thunar-properties-dialog.{c,h}: Add the first draft for the
	  ThunarPropertiesDialog class, which implements a properties dialog for
	  a single file.

	  thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml: Add the "properties" action to the
	  menu structure, which displays a properties dialog for the selected
	  file.

2005-07-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.{c,h}: Extend the ThunarVfsVolumeManager
	  interface to be able to query the ThunarVfsVolume for a given
	  ThunarVfsInfo.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-{bsd,sysv}.c: Catch up with the latest
	  ThunarVfsVolumeManager changes.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c(thunar_vfs_volume_bsd_new): Add
	  support for SCSI direct access devices.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add thunar_file_get_volume() to be able
	  to query the ThunarVfsVolume for a given ThunarFile, if possible.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Implement the newly added get_volume()
	  method based on the ThunarVfsVolumeManager.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Use the new volume related functionality
	  to display the free space of the currently active directory in the
	  statusbar.

2005-07-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/papers/HackingOnThunar.odt: Improve the "Hacking on Thunar"
	  guide.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.{c,h}: Change the icon lookup mechanism
	  to return an icon name instead of a GtkIconInfo object. Also allow
	  the ThunarVfsVolume implementation to specify a custom icon by
	  overriding the lookup_icon_name() method. Add a new method
	  get_free_space() which can be used to determine the amount of free
	  space on a given volume.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c: Catch up with the changes to
	  ThunarVfsVolume.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c: Cache icons for the favourites and

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_init): Add frame
	  shadow to the standard views.

2005-07-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-clipboard-manager.c: Fake an "owner-changed" event
	  for the clipboard if either GDK or the Xserver do not support the
	  XFixes extension.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c: Monitor the associated clipboard for
	  changes. Enable the "paste" action only if the both the current
	  directory is writable and the clipboard contents are pastable.

2005-07-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-user.c(thunar_vfs_user_manager_init): Use
	  direct hashing instead of int hashing.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c(thunar_local_file_get_emblem_names): If
	  the file cannot be written, return the "noread" emblem as well.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add can_execute(), can_read() and
	  can_write() methods, and a default implementation, so not every
	  class derived from ThunarFile needs to implement these methods of
	  its own.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.c(thunar_standard_view_selection_changed):
	  Update the "cut" and "paste" actions depending on whether the
	  current directory is writable.

2005-07-12	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-vfs-uri.c(thunar_vfs_uri_list_to_string): Use GString
	  to build the URI list string.
	* thunar/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Add a method thunar_vfs_uri_list_copy()
	  which duplicates a list of ThunarVfsURIs.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c(thunar_vfs_volume_bsd_finalize):
	  Properly remove the update timer here.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_remove): Perform the
	  GtkTreeModel delete operation prior to notifying the "num-files"
	  property to make sure the selection of the view is updated before
	  the standard-view requests the statusbar text for the selection.
	* TODO: Add another two issues.
	* thunar/thunar-clipboard-manager.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am: Add the new
	  ThunarClipboardManager class, which does the interaction with the
	  clipboard.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}: Implement Copy/Cut operations based
	  on the newly added ThunarClipboardManager class.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml: Add
	  clipboard operations to the "Edit" menu.

2005-07-12	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Add a readonly property "ui-manager" to the
	  ThunarWindow and use property binding to sync the UI manager with
	  the ThunarView.

2005-07-12	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml:
	  Specify the name in addition to the action.

2005-07-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-navigator.c(thunar_navigator_class_init): Use
	  EXO_PARAM_READWRITE instead of G_PARAM_READWRITE.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Fix several bugs related to incorrect
	  signal registration/removal in the hidden files handling.
	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: Add a new "ui-manager" property, which is
	  set by the surrounding window for the view in question. The view in
	  turn can hook its own actions - and thereby menu and toolbar items -
	  into the ui manager, using GtkUIManager's merging capabilities.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_init): Tell the main view about
	  our UI manager.
	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/thunar-standard-view-ui.xml,
	  thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am: Add initial
	  support for menu merging to the standard view class - and thereby to
	  the icon and details view. You can now control the "show-hidden"
	  property of the main view's model from the menu bar.

2005-07-10	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: Readd the get_statusbar_text() method.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c(thunar_favourites_view_row_activated):
	  Make sure the activated row is not the separator row, as calling
	  thunar_navigator_change_directory() with NULL for the directory
	  parameter will lead to a crash.
	* thunar/thunar-standard-view.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-details-view.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-icon-view.{c,h}, thunar/Makefile.am: Add a new abstract
	  base class ThunarStandardView, which is inherited by ThunarIconView
	  and ThunarDetailsView. ThunarStandardView itself is derived from
	  GtkScrolledWindow. This change was made to reduce the amount of
	  duplicated code in ThunarIconView and ThunarDetailsView, and to
	  workaround the problem that Gtk style properties don't pickup the
	  custom properties for certain widgets once you have a derived class.
	* thunar/thunar-statusbar.{c,h}: Revert to the previous ThunarStatusbar
	  implementation, which has a single "text" property that is bound to
	  the "statusbar-text" property of the active view.
	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: ThunarView now inherits (in terms of
	  interface inheritance) from ThunarNavigator, which will allow for
	  unified handling in ThunarWindow. In addition, the ThunarView now
	  provides a "loading" and a "statusbar-text" property (both readonly)
	  to put the view back in control of the loading process.

2005-07-07	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c: Be sure to register the type in a
	  thread-safe manner.

2005-07-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c:
	  Also provide a GtkWindow instance to the action list generator, so
	  actions can fire dialogs if necessary.

2005-07-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c:
	  Add possibility to remove user-defined shortcuts from the list.

2005-07-03	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c(thunar_favourites_model_get_value):
	  The ThunarVfsVolume interface does no longer provide the "name"
	  property.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c: Read the label from the ISO9660
	  volume descriptor block whenever a new medium is inserted and use
	  this label as name.

2005-07-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window-ui.xml, thunar/Makefile.am,
	  thunar/thunar-window.c: The UI description for the ThunarWindow is
	  now placed in a separate XML file for easier editing, and compiled
	  into the binary using the exo-csource utility.

2005-07-02	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add checks for functions used in the user module.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-user.{c,h}: Add a user module to the VFS
	  library, which is extensible and performs some caching to reduce
	  the overhead caused by the underlying NSS implementation.
	* docs/papers/HackingOnThunar.odt: Add comments about the newly added
	  ThunarVfsUser module.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.h: Add ThunarVfsUserId and ThunarVfsGroupId
	  typedefs.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.h, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Add the new
	  ThunarVfsUser module to the build framework.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-local-file.c,
	  thunar/thunar-trash-file.c: Add two new methods to the ThunarFile
	  class - get_group() and get_user() - and add an implementation of
	  these methods to the local and trash backends.

2005-06-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-details-view-icon-renderer.c
	  (thunar_details_view_icon_renderer_render): Add support to render
	  the primary emblem of the given file.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add support to query the list of emblems
	  for a given ThunarFile.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Implement the ThunarFile emblem support
	  for symbolic links.

2005-06-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-details-view-icon-renderer.{c,h}: Add a custom icon
	  renderer for the details view.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: Allow consumers of this model to
	  query the file for a given row.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add the new ThunarDetailsViewIconRenderer class
	  to the build framework.
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c(thunar_details_view_init): Use the custom
	  icon renderer instead of the generic pixbuf renderer provided by Gtk+.

2005-06-29	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c: Make this behave like GtkFileChooser
	  again.

2005-06-28	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.c:
	  Remove the GObject properties from the ThunarVfsVolume interface.

2005-06-26	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}: Do not automatically determine the
	  link target for ThunarVfsInfo objects. Instead, we'll add a method
	  to ThunarVfsInfo later, so modules can do this on-demand. This speeds
	  up loading directories with lots of symlinks within.
	* TODO: Remove the ThunarVfsInfo symlink item.

2005-06-26	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Don't use a GObject for the
	  ThunarVfsURI class. GObject is really overhead here, as we don't need
	  anything of whats provided by GObject.
	* TODO: Add note about missing GValue handling for ThunarVfsURI.
	* TODO: Add note to fix ThunarVfsInfo to not implicitly query the
	  link target.
	* thunar-vfs/*.[ch], thunar/*.[ch]: Use thunar_vfs_uri_unref() and
	  thunar_vfs_uri_ref() instead of g_object_unref() and g_object_ref(),
	  as ThunarVfsURI is no longer a GObject derived type.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Make loading new directories look and feel
	  "smoother". Still not perfect.

2005-06-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Use a static variable for the VFS monitor
	  instead of a class variable, that never gets freed with static types.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c: Watch the files in the favourites
	  list for changes, so that folders that no longer exists are
	  automatically removed from the list.

2005-06-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-navigator.c(thunar_navigator_get_type): Do not require
	  derived classes to inherit GtkWidget. This enables us to let arbitrary
	  classes implement the ThunarNavigator interface and therefore reduce
	  the amount of hardcoded knowledge in ThunarWindow.
	* thunar/thunar-side-pane.c(thunar_side_pane_get_type): Require derived
	  classes to inhert GtkWidget.

2005-06-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c(thunar_details_view_init): Use a
	  GtkCellRendererText instead of an ExoCellRendererEllipsizedText
	  for the name column.
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Set proper
	  ATK name and descriptions here.

2005-06-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/main.c(main): Disable thread support for now, as it's not used
	  and just slows down stuff.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-local-file.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-local-folder.c, thunar/thunar-trash-file.c: Watch local
	  directories and trashed files for changes.

2005-06-25	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c
	  (thunar_location_buttons_set_current_directory): Don't display the
	  real root node - the 'computer:'-node - if a sub-node is active. So
	  currently we have four distinctive possible roots for the location
	  buttons bar, which are the home directory of the user, the file system
	  root node ('file:/'), the trash root ('trash:') and the real computer
	  root node ('computer:'), which are checked in the given order.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_value): Use slightly
	  larger icons for the details view.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Add preliminary menu support with 'Close'
	  and 'Go up'.

2005-06-24	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Add support for the 'computer://'
	  URI.
	* thunar/thunar-trash-folder.c, thunar/thunar-local-folder.c,
	  thunar/thunar-folder.c: Drop the GObject properties, as they are
	  mostly useless here.
	* thunar/main.c(main): Use thunar_vfs_uri_new() for the optional
	  command line parameter to be able to open arbitrary URIs from the
	  command line.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add new class ThunarComputerFolder to the build
	  framework.
	* thunar/thunar-computer-folder.{c,h}: Add ThunarComputerFolder class,
	  which implements the 'computer:' URI. This vfolder is the root of all
	  other root folders, currently 'file:/' and 'trash:'.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-folder.c,
	  thunar/thunar-list-model.c, thunar/thunar-local-file.c,
	  thunar/thunar-local-folder.c, thunar/thunar-statusbar.c,
	  thunar/thunar-trash-file.c, thunar/thunar-trash-folder.c: Add support
	  for the 'computer:' vfolder as overall root node. Rearrange the
	  get_size() method to be able to support objects for which no size
	  is known, currently vfolders and directories in general. The virtual
	  get_mime_info() method now automatically takes a reference on the
	  returned object for the caller.

2005-06-24	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add check for localtime_r.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add support to query accessed, changed and
	  modified dates of ThunarFiles.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c, thunar/thunar-trash-file.c: Implement
	  the virtual get_date() method.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: Add new columns accessed date,
	  modified date and mime type. Fix the sorting for the mime comment
	  column.
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c: Display type and date modified columns
	  as well.

2005-06-23	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/papers/HackingOnThunar.odt, docs/papers/Makefile.am,
	  configure.in.in, docs/Makefile.am: Add initial draft of the "Hacking
	  on Thunar" paper.

2005-06-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c, thunar/thunar-local-folder.c: If for
	  some reason the constructor fails, we need to make sure to handle
	  the floating reference correctly, therefore we call gtk_object_sink()
	  instead of g_object_unref() in this case now.

2005-06-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-file.c, thunar/thunar-local-folder.c: Add an assertion
	  to verify that an object has a floating reference before we call
	  gtk_object_sink() on it.

2005-06-22	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* TODO: Addd new TODO items and remove solved issues.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add new class ThunarTrashFile to the build
	  framework.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.c(thunar_vfs_monitor_add_info): Do not
	  use kevent for symlinks, it's way easier to watch them using regular
	  polling. This shouldn't be a problem anyways, as watching symlinks
	  is not a common case.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-trash.{c,h}: Add functionality to handle trash:
	  URIs and determine the real path for a file in a particular trash
	  can.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-trash.c(thunar_vfs_trash_manager_get_trashes):
	  Fix a typo where the order of arguments to the g_list_prepend()
	  function was wrong.
	* thunar/thunar-trash-file.{c,h}: Add a ThunarTrashFile class, which
	  represents a trashed file.
	* thunar/thunar-trash-folder.c: Add support for listing the contents
	  of the various trash cans, and also provide a simple proxy mechanism,
	  that automatically forwards the constructor invokation to the
	  ThunarTrashFile class if required. The trash can handling must be
	  improved, see bug #1027.

2005-06-21	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_set_current_directory): Use
	  thunar_file_open_as_folder() to open new folders.
	* thunar/thunar-folder.{c,h}: ThunarFolder is now an interface, which
	  can be implemented in different ways.
	* thunar/thunar-local-folder.{c,h}: The previous ThunarFolder is now
	  named ThunarLocalFolder.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add thunar_file_open_as_folder() virtual
	  method, which allows the ThunarFile implementation to choose an
	  appropriate ThunarFolder implementation and thereby removes the
	  need for the surrounding modules to "guess" the correct ThunarFolder.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Implement the open_as_folder() method
	  for local files by simply instantiating a ThunarLocalFolder on the
	  file in question.
	* thunar/thunar-trash-folder.{c,h}: The ThunarTrashFile class is now
	  named ThunarTrashFolder as it really represents the trash toplevel
	  folder. It also implements the ThunarFolder interface now. The real
	  folder implementation is missing currently.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Sync the build framework with the changes
	  described above.

2005-06-20	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.c(thunar_vfs_monitor_event): Remove
	  unused variables.
	* thunar/thunar-folder.c: Apply the same optimization concerning signal
	  id lookups and closure generations as done with ThunarListModel
	  earlier.
	* thunar/thunar-folder.c: Actually react to events on the corresponding
	  file. We still need a mode in which we'll handle errors in async
	  folder reloads.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.c: Drop the cached MIME type whenever the
	  file changes. The MIME type will be recalculated on demand when
	  needed.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c: Instead of binding to the icon theme
	  instance's "changed" signal and risking that somebody else already
	  registered a handler earlier, we use a signal emission hook now, which
	  is garantied to be fired before any of the signal handlers are
	  invoked. See the code for details and additional comments.

2005-06-20	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-local-file.h: Add missing THUNAR_LOCAL_FILE_GET_CLASS().
	* configure.in.in: Add checks for kqueue() and required headers.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h}: thunar_vfs_info_update() is now
	  part of the public API as it's used by monitor and will be used
	  by the ThunarLocalFile implementation later as well.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.{c,h}: Add implementation for most
	  of the ThunarVfsMonitor. The current implementation uses kqueue()
	  if available with a fallback to regular polling.

2005-06-20	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Instead of resolving the ids for the
	  "destroy" and "changed" signals on ThunarFile everytime we need to
	  register it, we query the signal id in the constructor and remember
	  it. In addition, instead of creating a closure for every signal
	  registration on a ThunarFile, we create a closure for "changed" and
	  a closure for "destroy" in the constructor and reuse that closure
	  everytime we need to register a signal handler.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c: Watch hidden files for "destroy" condition
	  as well.
	* thunar/thunar-trash-file.c: Emit the "changed" signal whenever the
	  "empty" property on the trash manager changes.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add a method thunar_file_changed(), which
	  is used by derived classes to emit the "changed" signal on a given
	  ThunarFile.

2005-06-19	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-trash.{c,h}: Import first implementation of a
	  trash manager into thunar-vfs. Does currently only support the "home
	  trash", but will be extended to use the volume manager in order to
	  support foreign trashes as well.
	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Add the trash manager to the build framework.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.h: Include the trash manager header.
	* thunar/thunar-trash-file.c: Make use of the experimental trash
	  manager to display the proper icon depending on whether the trash
	  is full or empty.

2005-06-19	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-statusbar.c, thunar/thunar-list-model.c,
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c: Fix bug, where Thunar crashed when
	  NULL was returned for a mime info.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Turn this into an abstract base class, which
	  can be implemented in different ways.
	* thunar/thunar-local-file.{c,h}: Implementation of the abstract
	  ThunarFile class for local files handled by the 'file:///' URI
	  scheme.
	* thunar/thunar-trash-file.{c,h}: Implementation of the abstract
	  ThunarFile class for trashed files handled by the 'trash:///' URI
	  scheme and the trash can itself. This is currently only a boilerplate
	  and waiting for the trash backend to show up.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add new classes to the build framework.

2005-06-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-details-view.c(thunar_details_view_init): Use the
	  ellipsizing text renderer for the name column and get the sizing
	  correct.

2005-06-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: Further improve the interface to ease the
	  implementation and reduce the amount of duplicated code in the view
	  implementations.
	* thunar/thunar-details-view.{c,h}: Add a first implementation for a
	  details view.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Catch up with the changes to ThunarView.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Test the new ThunarDetailsView.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add ThunarDetailsView class to the build
	  framework.

2005-06-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: Adjust the interface for views to be more
	  like the FilerView interface, which makes things slightly easier and
	  adds more flexibility for the statusbar. Also the "list-model"
	  property is now named "model", which is the easiest way for both
	  ExoIconView and GtkTreeView, and it's safe to name it that way, as
	  the ThunarView interface is the only way to change models anyways.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: Drop the statusbar text generator.
	  It's now handled completely within the ThunarStatusbar class, which
	  provides more flexibility.
	* thunar/thunar-statusbar.{c,h}: Each statusbar instance is now
	  associated with a ThunarView instance and automatically updates the
	  status text according to the view.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Implement modified ThunarView interface,
	  which makes things very easy here for now.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Catch up with the changes to the other
	  classes.

2005-06-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-icon-factory.c: Implement the recently used list using
	  a circular buffer. This saves us from having to memmove() the list
	  content on every icon lookup.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c(thunar_window_set_current_directory): Use
	  a simple optimization when loading new folders into a view. See the
	  code comments for details about the trick.

2005-06-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Depend on GLib 2.6 for now.

2005-06-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-sysv.{c,h}: Add no-op implementation
	  to make it possible to compile Thunar on non-BSD systems again.
	* configure.in.in, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am,
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.c, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c:
	  Add a rather hacky way to support different system flavours based
	  on AC_CONFIG_LINKS(). Needs to be replaced by a real solution at
	  some time.
	* TODO: Add note about the wacky AC_CONFIG_LINKS() hacks mentioned
	  above.

2005-06-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c(thunar_vfs_uri_new_for_path): Add some
	  code to automatically remove trailing slashes from path names, which
	  would otherwise confuse the whole file manager.
	* thunar/thunar-fallback-icon.{h,png}, thunar/Makefile.am: The fallback
	  icon is now stored in a C file and automatically generated at compile
	  time if maintainer mode is enabled, while dist tarballs will ship the
	  generated C file.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-factory.{c,h}: Add new class ThunarIconFactory,
	  which provides caching of themed icons. The basic concept is based
	  on the NautilusIconFactory class, but the implementation is simpler
	  and faster than the implementation found in Nautilus.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c: Use the new ThunarIconFactory class and the
	  new exo_mime_info_lookup_icon_name() method to lookup and cache icons
	  for files. This speeds up folder loading quite a lot.
	* docs/design/overview.xmi: Add ThunarIconFactory diagram.

2005-06-13	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add header checks required for the BSD volume
	  manager implementation.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Display the current folder's special name.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add property "special-name", which contains
	  the special name of a given file if any, else it contains the same
	  value as the "display-name" property.
	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c: Use the home directory as root.
	  Don't display a label for the 'Filesystem' node, similar to how it
	  is done with GtkFileChooser.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c: Try more advanced features, like
	  detecting whether a medium is present for a given volume. This is
	  currently just testing, based on what is provided by the BSD
	  interface. The final design may look different, maybe even a
	  D-BUS based thunar-volume-manager service, which can be run with
	  special permissions in order to be able to query device stats and
	  mount volumes.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c: Use the new features provided by
	  the volume manager to dynamically display volumes when a medium is
	  inserted.

2005-06-12	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/design/overview.xmi: Refined the basic ideas for the volume
	  manager, which will provide core functionality required by the
	  trash system. The ThunarVfsVolume and ThunarVfsVolumeManager concepts
	  are interfaces now, which will be implemented by the backend (usually
	  one backend per operating system family).
	* tests/data/test-thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.fstab, tests/data/Makefile.am,
	  tests/test-thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.c, tests/Makefile.am: Add test case
	  for the BSD specific implementation of the ThunarVfsVolumeManager
	  module.
	* tests/test-thunar-vfs-uri.c: Fix copyright and includes.
	* TODO: Add item about possible improvements of the BSD specific
	  volume manager implementation.
	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.h, configure.in.in: Add
	  new classes and interfaces to the build framework.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume.{c,h}: Import the basic interfaces to
	  the volume manager module, with a minimum set of methods and signals,
	  which will be extended later.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-volume-bsd.{c,h}: Add first try of an
	  implementation of the the volume manager interfaces for BSD systems.

2005-06-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/design/overview.xmi: Extend the ThunarVfsURI functionality.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Add host handling to ThunarVfsURI.
	  Add support for different URI schemes, currently 'file://' and
	  'trash://'.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c, thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c, 
	  thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c: Sync with the little API change
	  to ThunarVfsURI.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Delete core files on `make clean'.
	* tests/test-thunar-vfs-uri.c(main): Add test cases for the trash:
	  scheme.

2005-06-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, Makefile.am, tests/: Import first test program for
	  ThunarVfsURI validation.

2005-06-11	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Add functions to ease the handling
	  of URI lists, specifically to automatically parse and generate
	  string representations of URI lists that conform to the
	  text/uri-list mime type.
	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.c
	  (thunar_location_buttons_drag_data_get): Use new ThunarVfsURI list
	  handling functions instead.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c
	  (thunar_favourites_model_file_destroy): Handle the case where a
	  directory referenced by a favourite disappears from the backend media.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c
	  (thunar_favourites_model_file_changed): Remove a given favourite if
	  the system notices that the favourite's file no longer refers to a
	  directory.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c(thunar_favourites_model_init): Do
	  not re-add favourites initially, that do not refer to a directory.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.{c,h}: Add a new method
	  thunar_favourites_model_add(), which is used by the
	  ThunarFavouritesView to add new favourites to the list and
	  automatically sync the changes with the Gtk+ bookmarks list.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c: Handle "text/uri-list" drops,
	  adding new favourites as appropriate. Add note, that the initial
	  idea is based on the GtkFileChooser written by Red Hat for Gtk+.
	* TODO: Remove the 'text/uri-list'-handling for ThunarFavouritesView.
	  Add item concerning the Trash in the favourites list.

2005-06-10	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c: Add initial drag&drop-support for
	  the favourites view. This is currently limited to rearranging
	  favourites in the list. Support for adding new favourites by
	  dropping text/uri-list's will be added soon. Also, the
	  ThunarFavouritesModel also saves changes made by the user back to
	  the .gtk-bookmarks file now.
	* TODO: Add note about missing text/uri-list support in
	  ThunarFavouritesView, and missing .gtk-bookmarks monitor support.

2005-06-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c: Use a signed gint for the number
	  of favourites to be compatible with the Gtk+ API.

2005-06-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* autogen.sh: Better determine the file dynamically, which is used to
	  query the sandbox revision.

2005-06-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* autogen.sh, configure.in.in: Add build number to the version during
	  development.

2005-06-08	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* docs/design/overview.xmi: All navigational UI elements in a
	  ThunarWindow now implement the ThunarNavigator interface, which
	  defines the "current-directory" property and the "change-directory"
	  signal. See the ThunarNavigator gtk-docs for details about the
	  behaviour.
	* thunar/thunar-navigator.{h,c}: Provide source code for the current
	  ThunarNavigator interface.
	* thunar/thunar-side-pane.{h,c}, thunar/thunar-favourites-pane.c:
	  Changed to use ThunarNavigator instead. ThunarSidePane is currently
	  an empty interface.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{h,c}: Add a thunar_vfs_uri_to_string()
	  method, which transform a ThunarVfsURI into a file:// uri.
	* thunar/thunar-location-bar.{h,c}: Provide source code for the
	  ThunarLocationBar interface, which extends the ThunarNavigator
	  interface. The ThunarLocationBar interface does not add anything new
	  currently, but that will change in future revisions.
	* thunar/thunar-location-buttons.{c,h}: Add location path buttons
	  implementation of the ThunarLocationBar interface. The layouting
	  code was mostly copied from gtkpathbar.c, which was initially
	  written by Jonathan Blandford. The implementation is not complete
	  yet, and the layouting code is still very buggy.
	* TODO: Add a bunch of TODO items for Thunar 1.0.

2005-06-07	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_set_folder): Fix a bug
	  where the signals for the ThunarFolder weren't connected if the
	  folder contained no files initially.
	* thunar/thunar-side-pane.c(thunar_side_pane_class_init): Fix typo in
	  the documentation.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}: Add new method thunar_file_get_parent() to
	  figure out the parent directory for a given ThunarFile.

2005-06-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c(thunar_vfs_uri_finalize): Use the
	  parent_class variable set by G_DEFINE_TYPE instead of dynamically
	  querying the parent class on-demand.
	* thunar/thunar-application.c, thunar/thunar-desktop-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c, thunar/thunar-favourites-pane.c,
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c, thunar/thunar-file.c,
	  thunar/thunar-folder.c, thunar/thunar-icon-view.c,
	  thunar/thunar-preferences.c, thunar/thunar-statusbar.c,
	  thunar/thunar-window.c: G_DEFINE_TYPE and G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_CODE
	  already generate a parent_class variable, so we don't need to do
	  that manually as well. It looks like this was added with GLib 2.4.x
	  and I somehow missed that change. Thanks to Jeff Franks for pointing
	  this out.

2005-06-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c: Fix a bug in the thunar_vfs_uri_parent()
	  and thunar_vfs_uri_relative() methods, where the name attribute of
	  the newly created objects wasn't initialized properly.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.c(thunar_vfs_uri_equal): Instead of always
	  comparing the full path of both URIs, a simple optimization was
	  introduced, which checks the basenames first, if they are equal,
	  it'll check whether the dirnames have the same length, and as the
	  last fallback, it'll compare the dirnames char by char. This way we
	  can optimize the common case - with GHashTable - that two URIs
	  differ.

2005-06-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.{c,h}: Add new method
	  thunar_favourites_model_file_for_iter() to be able to easily
	  determine the ThunarFile for a given favourite.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_class_init): Fix a type in the
	  "changed" signal definition.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_finalize): Fix a bug where the
	  ThunarVfsURI was freed first, and then an attempt was made to remove
	  the ThunarFile from the file_cache using the previously freed
	  ThunarVfsURI as key.
	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: Add the "change-directory" signal, which
	  is emitted by ThunarIconView and ThunarListView whenever the user
	  double clicks a folder (or otherwise requests a directory change
	  from within the view).
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: Add a thunar_list_model_new()
	  default constructor, which does not take a ThunarFolder instance.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-view.c: Implement the "change-directory" signal
	  in ThunarView.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-view.c, thunar/thunar-favourites-pane.c:
	  Double-clicking a favourite now opens the associated directory (using
	  the "current-directory" property, which is linked to the
	  "current-directory" property of ThunarWindow).
	* thunar/thunar-window.{c,h}: Add a "current-directory" property,
	  which describes the directory currently displayed in this window.
	  Remove the thunar_window_new_with_folder() constructor and replace
	  it by a default constructor. Automatically synchronize the current
	  directory with both the view and the side pane.
	* thunar/main.c(main): ThunarWindow now uses ThunarFile to refer to
	  the active directory and so we do here as well.

2005-06-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Bumped version to 0.0.2.
	* docs/design/overview.xmi: Fix some issues, see the code changes
	  below.
	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Don't install the thunar-vfs library for
	  now. Makes debugging easier.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add new classes to the build framework.
	* thunar/thunar-view.{c,h}: Implement first draft for the ThunarView
	  interface, which is to beimplemented by all views.
	* thunar/thunar-icon-view.{c,h}: Implement first draft for the
	  ThunarIconView class, which implements the ThunarView interface to
	  provide an icon view of the current folder.
	* thunar/thunar-statusbar.{c,h}: Add basic implementation of the
	  ThunarStatusbar class. In order to avoid an association between the
	  ThunarView or ThunarListModel classes and the ThunarStatusbar and in
	  order to provide more flexibility about what is to be displayed in
	  the statusbar, we use a write-only property "text" for the
	  ThunarStatusbar, which can be connected to another string property
	  using the ExoBindings module.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: The number of rows should be a gint
	  rather than a guint, as that's what GtkTreeModel uses. Add a new
	  method thunar_list_model_get_statusbar_text(), that will be used by
	  both ThunarIconView and ThunarListView to determine the proper
	  statusbar text that should be displayed for a given selection. Add a
	  new column THUNAR_LIST_MODEL_COLUMN_TYPE, which provides a string
	  representation of the MIME-Type (using the comment set for the
	  MIME-Type). The sort function is not yet implemented tho.

2005-06-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.c(thunar_favourites_model_get_value):
	  The display_name's of ThunarFile's can be considered static (as the
	  name cannot change during the ThunarFile's life-time), so we don't
	  need to take a copy here.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.c(thunar_list_model_get_value): Same here,
	  the ThunarFile's display_name is static.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c: Add the simple caching on the ThunarFile
	  level. If a ThunarFile for the same ThunarVfsURI is requested
	  multiple times, the same ThunarFile instance will be used, instead
	  of allocating a new one. Future versions will extend this scheme
	  using a smarter caching mechanism.
	* thunar/thunar-side-pane.{c,h}: Add implementation for the
	  ThunarSidePane interface, which is to be implemented by all widgets
	  that can be placed on the right side. The interface currently
	  includes only the "current-directory" property, which is the most
	  important communication mechanism. We'll need some way to pass in
	  other per-window settings here (e.g. "show-hidden" and such).
	  Hopefully somebody will pick up the preferences task soon.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-view.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-pane.{c,h}: More work on the
	  ThunarFavourites module. The ThunarFavouritesPane class implements
	  the ThunarSidePane interface and acts as a bridge to the underlying
	  ThunarFavouritesView.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Test the new ThunarFavouritesPane class.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add the new classes to the build framework.

2005-06-05	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Add thunar_vfs_uri_new()
	  constructor, that creates a new ThunarVfsURI object from a resource
	  identifier string.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Add thunar_vfs_uri_is_home(), which
	  determines whether a given ThunarVfsURI referes to the home
	  directory of the current user.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_load_icon): Pay attention to
	  special icons for the home folder and the file system root.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-view.{c,h}: Add experimental
	  ThunarFavouritesModel and ThunarFavouritesView classes, that will be
	  used in the implementation of the ThunarFavouritesPane class. Other
	  than with the mockups, I've skipped the 'Desktop' favourite for now,
	  as it does not make much sense. The usablity team should evaluate
	  this at some time.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Add ThunarFavouritesView on the left side
	  for testing.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add ThunarFavouritesModel and
	  ThunarFavouritesView to the build system.

2005-06-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Fix copyright texts.
	* docs/design/overview.xmi: Add is_local() and is_root() for
	  ThunarVfsURI, which were missing.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Implemented the missing
	  thunar_vfs_uri_is_root() and thunar_vfs_uri_parent() methods.

2005-06-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* COPYING.LIB: Add license text for the thunar-vfs library (which is
	  licensed under the LGPL).
	* HACKING: Add information for people that plan to hack on Thunar.
	* AUTHORS: Add Jeff Franks.
	* THANKS: Import the THANKS template.
	* README: Add some basic information about Thunar. Needs more details.
	* docs/design/overview.xmi: Import the current overview diagram for
	  Thunar.
	* Makefile.am, configure.in.in, docs/Makefile.am,
	  docs/design/Makefile.am: Include the docs/ tree with the build
	  framework.
	* configure.in.in, thunar/Makefile.am, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Link
	  against GThread (not yet required from what is coded so far).
	* configure.in.in: Check for several required header files.
	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-util.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.h: Add some experimental source code to
	  implement parts of the VFS module.
	* thunar/fallback-icon.h, thunar/fallback-icon.png: Import the
	  fallback icon.
	* thunar/thunar-application.{c,h}: Import Jeff's ThunarApplication
	  boilerplate (adjusting style as required).
	* thunar/thunar-desktop-view.{c,h}: Boilerplate for the
	  ThunarDesktopView class with the very basic requirements.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-folder.{c,h}: Experimental
	  implementation of ThunarFile and ThunarFolder based on the
	  experimental source for the VFS module.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: Sample implementation of the
	  ThunarListModel class, based on an earlier implementation found in
	  Filer.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.{c,h}: Template for the ThunarPreferences
	  class.
	* thunar/thunar-window.{c,h}: Quick-and-dirty ThunarWindow
	  implementation to be able to roughly test the ThunarListModel class.
	* thunar/main.c: Add code to start a single ThunarWindow.
	* autogen.sh: Copyright fixes. Substitute date to make it easier to
	  identify snapshots during the early development stages.
