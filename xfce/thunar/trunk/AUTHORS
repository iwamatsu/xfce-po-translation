The tdb library, which is included with the Thunar distribution, was originally
written as part of the Samba suite. My understanding is that the majority of
the code was written by Andrew Trigell <tridge@linuxcare.com> with the help of
Paul "Rusty" Russell <rusty@linuxcare.com>. Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton
<luke@samba.org> also contributed a few patches. Sorted freelist merge code
added by Jeremy Allison <jeremy@valinux.com>.
