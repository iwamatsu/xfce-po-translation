Bug tracking system
===================

libexo uses the bug tracking system at http://bugzilla.xfce.org/
hosted and maintained by the Xfce project.


Patches
=======

Please submit patches to the Xfce bug tracking system or to the
people listed in the AUTHORS file. Your patch should be in unified
diff format (the -u option to GNU diff).

Please and send a patch against a recent version of this package. Patches
against the Subversion trunk branch are most preferable. You can always
access the trunk branch from 

  http://svn.xfce.org/listing.php?repname=xfce4&path=/libexo/#/libexo/


Feature requests
================

Please file feature requests to the Xfce bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product libexo) with a Severity of
enhancement. Make sure that your feature request wasn't reported
already before; requesting a feature several times won't increase
the chance that it gets added.


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is necessary!


Release process
===============

  1) Check out a fresh copy from Subversion
  2) Increment the version number in configure.in.in and the major version
     number of the library whenever new functions got added
  3) Update NEWS and ChangeLog, and don't forget to add a note about the new
     release to ChangeLog, so people can see which changes appeared in which

                https://xfce.org/svn/xfce/libexo/tags/exo-X.Y.Ztag"
     where X.Y.Z is the version number and tag is the version tag, i.e. beta1.
