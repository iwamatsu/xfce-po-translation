What is it?
===========

This is libexo, an extension library to Xfce, developed by os-cillation. While
Xfce comes with quite a few libraries that are targeted at desktop development,
libexo is targeted at application development.


Current state
=============

libexo is considered ready for production use. You do no longer need to
define the EXO_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE preprocessor symbol.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.


Debugging Support
=================

libexo currently supports three different levels of debugging support, which
can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output of
`configure --help'):

  `yes'		This is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all kinds
  		of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run slower.
		Use this for development of libexo and locating bugs in libexo.

  `minimum'	This is the default for release builds. This is the recommended
  		behaviour.

  `no'		Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know
  		exactly what you do.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product libexo). You will need
to create an account for yourself.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes
or bugfixes for this package.
