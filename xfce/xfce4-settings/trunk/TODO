Keyboard settings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * The default values of the sliders don't make sence. I think we should
    also show the slider value and add a tooltip to the slide what the
    value actually stands for, like in the mouse dialog.
    The maximum values also seem to be a bit high.
  * IMPORTANT (for the final release): Update the property-changed 
    handler so that they it adds a new row for new properties
  * IMPORTANT (for the final release): Improve the libfrap code for
    shortcuts. It could be less complicated.
  * IMPORTANT (for the final release): Hard-coded default shortcuts and
    an option to reset them to defaults (see xfwm4).


Mouse Settings (Nick)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Figure out the needed Xi and Xcursor dependency version.


Settings Helper
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Check for an already running instance. This is quite easy with
    a pid file, but I'm not sure that's a good solution...


Settings Manager
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Add embed support to all dialogs (not only those in xfce4-settings).
  * Figure out a way to avoid the black glitches that happen when 
    embedding dialogs into the main dialog sometimes.
  * Consider adding an X-Xfce-Embed=true key to the .desktop files of
    settings dialogs so that the main dialog can check if they support
    the embed feature or not.
  * Come up with a solution for help buttons (maybe using an additonal
    .desktop file key with a help URL for each settings dialog?).
  * Maybe make addding dialog-specific buttons to the button bar of the
    main dialog possible, dunno.


Display Settings (Nick)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Make it all work for individual screens.
  * Simple dual screen support (2 monitors only).
  * Figure out the needed Xrandr and Xxf86vm dependency version.
  * Maybe some sort of stored configurations for different setups
    (probably not in 4.6).
  * Hotplug support. Notify the user (with button to change the
    display settings). Could be integrated with the stored configs.
