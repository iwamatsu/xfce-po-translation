What is it?
===========

This is libxfce4menu, a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation for
Xfce. 


Current state
=============

libxfce4menu already covers the most important parts of the menu specification. 
It is however still in development and thus, neither stable nor complete.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.


Debugging Support
=================

libxfce4menu currently supports three different levels of debugging support, 
which can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output 
of `configure --help'):

  `yes'         This is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all kinds
                of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run slower.
                Use this for development of libxfce4menu and locating bugs in 
                libxfce4menu.

  `minimum'     This is the default for release builds. This is the recommended
                behaviour.

  `no'          Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know
                exactly what you do.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system 
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product libxfce4menu). You will need to create an 
account for yourself.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes or 
bugfixes for this package.
