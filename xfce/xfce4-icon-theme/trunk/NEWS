4.4.0
=====
- Switched to using xfce4-dev-tools and removed autogenerated files from the
  CVS repository.
- The index.theme was made translatable using intltool.
- Major icons changes, with new colors, smaller dark borders and some 3D
  effects.
- Several new icons, previously missing in mimetypes and stock categories.
- All icons have been resized so they let a little more space around them in
  apps which do not take care of that by themselves, like the Gnome
  panel/menu/file manager.
