	* NEWS: Update news.

2008-10-06	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/, panel-plugin/, xfce4-mixer/: Move the
	  xfce_mixer_stock_init() call into xfce_mixer_init(). Rename the
	  instance init function of XfceMixer to xfce_mixer_instance_init().
	  Reorder the includes and only include libxfce4mixer.h of the
	  header files in libxfce4mixer/.

2008-10-06	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/libxfce4mixer.c: Call gst_bus_remove_signal_watch() in
	  xfce_mixer_shutdown().
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.c: Remove locking mechanism from the
	  lock button toggle handler.

2008-10-06	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add DEBUG define for the DBG macro.

2008-10-06	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/, panel-plugin/, xfce4-mixer/: Remove XfceMixerCard
	  entirely and use GstMixer directly instead. Add methods 
	  xfce_mixer_init() and xfce_mixer_shutdown() to libxfce4mixer. Only 
	  determine the list of sound cards once inside xfce_mixer_init(). 
	  Move code from xfce-mixer-utilities.{c,h} to libxfce4mixer.{c,h}. 
	  Use a single GstBus for all sound cards. Add new methods 
	  xfce_mixer_bus_connect() and xfce_mixer_bus_disconnect(). Move 
	  methods from XfceMixerCard to libxfce4menu.{c,h} and 
	  xfce-mixer-preferences.{c,h}. Update all the other classes so that
	  they work with the new code.
	* po/xfce4-mixer.pot, po/*.po, po/POTFILES.in: Update POTFILES.in and
	  the po files (no new strings have been added though).

2008-10-05	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Depend on the latest version of xfconf.

2008-10-05	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card.{c,h}: Remove the functions 
	  xfce_mixer_card_connect() and xfce_mixer_card_disconnect(). Add a
	  new "track-changed" signal to XfceMixerCard instead. Make the
	  element and display name members GObject properties. Rename
	  xfce_mixer_card_get_message_owner() to
	  xfce_mixer_card_is_message_owner() and make it static.
	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-preferences.c: Use xfconf_channel_get()
	  instead of xfconf_channel_new(). Don't unref the channel in the
	  finalize function.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Make use of the new 
	  "track-changed" signal of XfceMixerCard. 
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Make the card member of XfceMixer a 
	  GObject property. Make use of the new "track-changed" signal of
	  XfceMixerCard. Move code from xfce_mixer_create_contents() into 
	  xfce_mixer_constructed().

2008-09-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.c: Use multimedia-volume-control
	  icon instead of xfce4-mixer icon.

2008-09-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/, libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-stock{c,h},
	  panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Update SVG and PNG icons. Add 
	  another icon with no volume bar at all for the ultra-low volume 
	  state between muted and 15% volume.

2008-09-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* ChangeLog: Insert 4.5.90 release information at the correct location
	  so that everyone can follow the changes made after that release.

2008-09-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/main.c, xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c,
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce4-mixer.desktop.in.in: Don't use the word "Xfce" in
	  the window title - be more generic and just call it "Mixer". Improve
	  a few labels and tooltips. Oh, and most importantly: Improve the
	  desktop file installed for the mixer application: Add the mixer to
	  the Audio and X-XFCE categories, support startup notification and
	  add Terminal=false.

2008-09-20	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/, xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c: Drop xfce4-mixer.{png,svg} 
	  icon in favour of multimedia-volume-control.
	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card.{c,h}: Fix compiler warnings due to
	  invalid conversion between "const gchar **" and "gchar * const *".

2008-09-18	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* autogen.sh: Add git svn revision versioning support.
	* configure.in.in, libxfce4mixer/Makefile.am, xfce4-mixer/Makefile.am:
	  Re-add svn version tag. Add dependency on xfconf.
	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card.{c,h},
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-preferences.{c,h}, xfce4-mixer/main.c,
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-controls-dialog.c,
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c, xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Add
	  xfconf support.

2008-09-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* === 4.5.90 released ===

2008-09-12	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* NEWS, README, TODO: Updated for the alpha release.

2008-09-09	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/, panel-plugin/, xfce4-mixer/: Fix a lot of compiler
	  warnings and return statements without a return value.

2008-09-03	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card-combo.{c,h}: Remove the method
	  xfce_mixer_card_combo_get_n_cards() again. 
	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-track-combo.c: When assuming the first
	  sound card (if no active sound card was passed to the constructor)
	  first check whether the sound card list is empty.
	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-utilities.{c,h}: Introduce new method
	  xfce_mixer_utilities_get_n_cards(). Only call
	  xfce_mixer_card_set_ready() if there is a sound card with the given
	  name in xfce_mixer_card_get_card_by_name(). Use internal name
	  instead of the cards display name in the same function.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Remember card connection id and
	  properly disconnect from the GstBus when destroying the mixer
	  plugin. Use command member of the plugin struct for the left-click
	  action of the volume button (use "xfce4-mixer" by default).
	  Dereference sound card and track when destroying the plugin. Display
	  useful error dialog when the volume button is clicked but the
	  left-click command is still undefined or empty. Don't allow
	  configuration of the plugin unless GStreamer has actually detected
	  at least one sound card. Avoid a warnings and crashes when no
	  sound cards are detected.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.{c,h}: Make the left-click command
	  configurable using an entry and a file chooser dialog. Use
	  GtkAlignments were possible to make the look consistent with other
	  Xfce settings dialogs.
	* panel-plugin/xfce4-mixer-plugin.desktop.in.in: Change plugin icon to
	  "multimedia-volume-control" instead of "xfce4-mixer".
	* xfce4-mixer/main.c, xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c: Display a 
	  useful error dialog and exit if no sound cards are available. Remove
	  the same dialog from the mixer window in turn.

2008-09-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c: Improve the previously added error
	  message.

2008-09-02	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card-combo. Add new method
	  xfce_mixer_card_combo_get_n_cards(). 
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c: Display error dialog with a hint
	  about sound specific GStreamer libraries if there were no sound
	  cards detected by GStreamer.

2008-09-01	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card.{c,h}: Add new method
	  xfce_mixer_card_disconnect() and return the signal handler ID from
	  xfce_mixer_card_connect(). 
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Disconnect from the XfceMixerCard in
	  xfce_mixer_finalize(). This way there will be no GstBus messages
	  sent to finalized XfceMixer objects any more. Fixes a bug on first
	  startup.

2008-09-01	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Add g_return_val_if_fail() call to
	  xfce_mixer_bus_message() in order to return when an invalid mixer
	  object is passed to the function.

2008-09-01	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Connect to the GstBus after creating the
	  mxier widgets, not before. This shouldn't change anything but it
	  makes more sense to me.

2008-08-31	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixe/xfce-mixer-card-combo.c,
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c: Remember the selected sound card so
	  that it is selected again on next startup. Use
	  xfce_mixer_card_get_name() instead of
	  xfce_mixer_card_get_display_name() to determine the active card
	  index in XfceMixerCardCombo.

2008-08-10	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Use mute icon only if the
	  mixer track is actually muted.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.c: Fix compiler warning due to
	  missing gst/interfaces/mixer.h include.

2008-07-17	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-preferences.c, xfce4-mixer/main.c,
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c: Fix a few memory leaks.

2008-06-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-track-combo.c,
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card-combo.c,
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-utilities.c,
	  panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c,
	  panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.c: Fix compiler warnings due
	  to missing includes.

2008-06-23	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card.c,
	  panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Fix a compiler warning and
	  and an error.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card.c: Improve
	  xfce_card_get_message_owner() by additionally comparing 
	  device names. I noticed that sometimes plugins are not
	  updated even though the GstBus should invoke the signal
	  handler. Hopefully, this fixes it.
	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-utilities.{c,h}: Add 
	  xfce_mixer_utilities_get_max_volume() to determine the
	  maximum volume in a gint array.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Don't call g_object_ref on
	  GstMixerTracks. Add methods for setting the card and track
	  used by the plugin. Improve the _update_track() method. 
	  Remove _replace_values() method. Add a lot of comments.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.c: Don't call g_object_ref on
	  the GstMixerTrack in xfce_plugin_dialog_get_data().

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/scalable/: Improved again.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Ignore GstBus messages
	  while applying changes to the active card/track to avoid
	  conflicting states.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/: Revamp icons yet again.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/scalable/*.svg: Update icons. I think they look better
	  this way.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Stop other "event-scroll"
	  handlers from being invoked after handling them inside the
	  volume button.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Add support for tooltips 
	  showing the currently used track and volume level in percent 
	  (e.g. 'Master: 50%').

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Preload icon pixbufs whenever
	  the icon size is changed.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Don't free the hash table keys as
	  they are owned by GStreamer. That introduced a really, really
	  weird bug ...
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.c: Use 5% step size for all 
	  faders.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.c: Fix crash when moving the 
	  fader of a mixer track with only one channel (which was 
	  caused by accessing the unitialized track->lock_button
	  variable).

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-option.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-switch.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Implement monitoring for mute,
	  record, volume, option and switch changes on all controls.
	  Works like a charm!

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card.c: Mark cards as ready when
	  creating them. If the state is changed asynchroneously, wait
	  until the state change is done before returning from
	  xfce_mixer_card_set_state_ready().

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Remove the keyboard 
	  grabbing feature. It causes too much problems. People without
	  a mousewheel will have to click the plugin and use the real
	  mixer for now.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-track-combo.c: Increment the counter
	  for determining the active track index only when playback
	  and capture tracks are found.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.{c,h}: Add "mute-toggled" 
	  signal for when the middle mouse button is clicked. Add 
	  xfce_volume_button_set_muted() method for manually changing
	  the mute state of the button (does not affect the actual sound
	  settings).
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Handle 
	  GST_MESSAGE_MUTE_TOGGLED messages by setting the muted state
	  of the plugin button.
	  
2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Add support for
	  xfce_mixer_card_connect() so that the volume button is updated
	  whenever the volume of the current mixer track is changed by
	  another program.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer.c: Parse GST_MESSAGE_VOLUME_CHANGED
	  messages, but don't handle them yet. In the mixer it's much more
	  complicated than in the plugin, gonna do that later.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/: Add volume level icons (1x muted, 5x different sound
	  wave icons). I'm not exactly satisfied, but it's better than
	  before.
	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-stock.{c,h}: Add support for the
	  icons mentioned above.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c, 
	  panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c,
	  panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.c: (Hopefully) improve icon
	  scaling. Make sure (I guess) not to crash when the properties
	  dialog returns crap (why would it? heck, what do I know?).

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-track-combo.c: Fix a wrong 
	  if-statement in xfce_mixer_track_combo_set_track(). Now the
	  current mixer track should be preselected correctly when
	  opening the properties dialog of the plugin.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Fix the button press
	  callback: Return TRUE when the middle button was pressed, 
	  return FALSE otherwise.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Add support for toggling
	  between minimum and last known volume using the middle 
	  mouse button.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Add support for GDK_Home
	  and GDK_End for changing the volume to the maximum/minimum
	  level.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/Makefile.am, 
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card-combo.{c,h},
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-track-combo.{c,h}, 
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-utilities.{c,h}:
	  Add subclasses of GtkComboBox for unified selection of 
	  sound cards and mixer tracks. Add convenience functions for
	  getting a list of available sound cards and getting sound
	  cards by name. 
	* panel-plugin/Makefile.am,
	  panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.{c,h},
	  panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.{c,h},
	  panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.{c,h}:
	  Implement the properties dialog of the plugin. By now it 
	  makes it possible to select which sound card and mixer track
	  to use. Also connect the plugin to GStreamer, so it actually 
	  does something. Add support for reading/writing the plugin 
	  configuration to the rc file. The volume button itself has
	  some focus grabbing problems: sometimes other windows don't
	  receive the focus even when the pointer leaves the button.
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c: Move the _load_soundcards 
	  method to the libxfce4mixer. Make use of the new 
	  XfceMixerCardCombo in XfceMixerWindow.

2008-06-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Try to start "xfce4-mixer" 
	  when the plugin button is clicked.

2008-06-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Huge code reorganization: Split the mixer into three parts: 
	  libxfce4mixer, xfce4-mixer and the panel plugin. libxfce4mixer
	  contains everything that's needed by both, the mixer and the 
	  plugin.
	* panel-plugin/: This will become a minimalistic, keyboard and 
	  scroll-wheel orientated plugin with no volume popup slider or
	  whatsoever. I'll have to add this later. Still missing: config
	  dialog and the connection to the soundcard.
	* xfce4-mixer/: I don't think I've changed anything in here, just
	  reorganized the code.

2008-01-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add support for version information, just like all
	  the other Xfce components have. Also add special debugging support
	  for SVN snapshots. Enhance the AC_COPYRIGHT value. Print build
	  configuration at the end of ./configure.

2008-01-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-card.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Add optional support for the GstMixer
	  notification API. It uses GstBus and GstMixerMessages. The latter
	  are only available with GStreamer >= 0.10.14. Not all work is done
	  yet, but it will be worked on this week.
	* autogen.sh: Tweak autogen.sh so that it works with both, SVN and
	  git-svn. 

2008-01-13	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer-card.{c,h}: Add XfceMixerCard class as a wrapper for
	  GstMixer. Implement a method (xfce_mixer_card_get_name()) to
	  work-around problems with sound card names containing characters
	  not allowed as section names (see Desktop Entry specification). 
	  This method is now used to store/load preferences of soundcards.
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.{c,h}, 
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-controls-dialog.{c,h}, 
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-option.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-switch.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.{c,h}
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.{c,h}: Use XfceMixerCard instead of
	  GstMixer everywhere. Change the main window subtitle to something
	  less enthusiastic. 

2008-01-13	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-controls-dialog.c: Don't set the default
	  response of the dialog.

2008-01-13	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Initial import of the new GStreamer-based mixer into trunk.

vim:set sw=8 sts=8 ts=8 noexpandtab:
