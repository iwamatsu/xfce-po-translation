xfce4-mixer Information
=======================

This package contains a volume control application based on GStreamer
0.10 written to conceptually fit into the Xfce desktop environment. It
also contains a plugin for the Xfce panel which is especially designed
for use with the mouse wheel.

Known Problems with GStreamer
-----------------------------

  * No sound card detected: if this happens you're probably missing a
    GStreamer plugin for your sound system. If you get this message on a
    Debian or Ubuntu system and you're using ALSA then installing 
    gstreamer0.10-alsa should fix it. On OpenBSD installing 
    gst-plugins-good might help.
