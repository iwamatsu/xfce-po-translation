NOTES for XFree86 users:
------------------------
If you are running XFree86, it is most likely, that you have only a static
variant of libXinerama installed. That might prevent you from using Xinerama
with XFce4 at all. So, in order to create a shared variant of -lXinerama,
become root and type the following commands:

	cd /usr/X11R6/lib
	ld --whole-archive -share -o libXinerama.so.1 libXinerama.a
	ln -s libXinerama.so.1 libXinerama.so

After that you need to rebuild and reinstall the whole XFce4 desktop.
If you have any problems with the above, please mail to benny@xfce.org.
