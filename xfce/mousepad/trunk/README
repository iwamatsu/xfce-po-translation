Mousepad - A simple text editor for Xfce


Description
===========

Mousepad is a text editor for Xfce based on Leafpad. The initial reason for 
Mousepad was to provide printing support, which would have been difficult 
for Leafpad for various reasons.

Although some features are under development, currently Mousepad has folowing
features:

    * Complete support for UTF-8 text
    * Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text
    * Search and Replace
    * Font selecton
    * Word Wrap
    * Character coding selection
    * Auto character coding detection (UTF-8 and some codesets)
    * Manual codeset setting
    * Infinite Undo/Redo by word
    * Auto Indent
    * Multi-line Indent
    * Display line numbers
    * Drag and Drop
    * Printing

Mousepad is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, see
the file 'COPYING' for more information.

Switching from Leafpad
======================
For those switching from Leafpad, here is good readable description of the
changes since Leafpad 0.7.9

First off, we've partially switched over to Xfce widgets. That means you get
whatever file chooser is best for your version of GTK+.

We've made the config file follow the XDG standard. The laymen's version is
that the config lives in ~/.config/mousepad instead of cluttering up your home
directory directly.

We also have printing support, which is nice. Previously Leafpad was only good
as a viewer/editor. Now you can do pretty much all the basic text filey things.
xfprint4, which is used to do the printing, can do pretty printing based on
file type. Nice for printing out shell scripts or other structured text.

We have an optional debugging build as well.
