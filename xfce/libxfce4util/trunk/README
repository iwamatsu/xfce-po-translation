Basic utility library for Xfce4.


Installation:
-------------

	Simply run

		./configure
		make
		make install
	
	For a list of available configure options, see the list as returned
	by

		./configure --help


Notes to cross-compilers:
-------------------------

	The check for "broken putenv" will fail for cross-compiling. Therefore
	you'll need to supply the --with-broken-putenv option to configure
	with a parameter of either yes or no (see the ./configure --help
	output). To determine if your plattform's putenv() is ok or
	broken, you can use the following test program:

  		#include <stdlib.h>
		#include <string.h>
		int main(int argc, char *argv[])
		{
		    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(8);
		    strcpy(buffer, "foo=bar");
		    putenv(buffer);
		    strcpy(buffer, "foo=rab");
		    return(strcmp(getenv("foo"), "bar") == 0 ? 0 : 1);
		}

	Just compile the program and run it. If it returns 0, then your
	plattform's putenv() is ok, and you should add --with-broken-putenv=no
	to ./configure, else you need --with-broken-putenv=yes.

	All glibc based plattforms (nearly all GNU/Linux systems, and GNU/Hurd,
	etc.) and Solaris plattforms are known to have the putenv() problem.
