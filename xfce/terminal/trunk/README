What is it?
===========

This is the Terminal emulator application. Terminal is a lightweight and
easy to use terminal emulator for the X windowing system, with some new
ideas and features that makes it unique among X terminal emulators.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.


Performance issues
==================

Terminal is based on the Vte terminal widget library, just like gnome-terminal.
Vte is probably not the fastest terminal emulation library on earth, but its
one of the best when it comes to Unicode support, and not to forget, its
actively developed. That said, performance is still an important issue for
a terminal emulator and Vte with font-antialiasing enabled can be very slow
even on decent systems. Terminal therefore offers the possibility to explicitly
disable anti-aliasing for the terminal font. If you are experiencing problems
with the terminal rendering speed, you might want to disable the anti-aliasing
for the terminal font.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Terminal). You will
need to create an account for yourself.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes
or bugfixes for this package.
