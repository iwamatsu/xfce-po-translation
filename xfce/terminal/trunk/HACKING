Bug tracking system
===================

Terminal uses the bug tracking system at http://bugzilla.xfce.org/
hosted and maintained by the Xfce Project.


Patches
=======

Please submit patches to the os-cillation bug tracking system or to the
people listed in the AUTHORS file. Your patch should be in unified diff
format (the -u option to GNU diff).

Please and send a patch against a recent version of this package. Patches
against the Subversion trunk branch are most preferable. You can always
access the trunk branch from 

  http://svn.xfce.org/listing.php?repname=xfce4&path=%2Fterminal%2F#/terminal/

or using an installed Subversion client

  svn co http://svn.xfce.org/svn/xfce/terminal/trunk/


Feature requests
================

Please file feature requests to the Xfce bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Terminal) with a Severity of
enhancement. Make sure that your feature request wasn't reported
already before; requesting a feature several times won't increase
the chance that it gets added.


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same
   as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is
   necessary!
 - Don't follow the philosophy "If it works, it's right" that most
   open source projects follow, instead Terminal's philosophy is
   "It doesn't work unless it's right".


Release process
===============

  1) Check out a fresh copy from Subversion
  2) Increment the version number in configure.ac
  3) Update NEWS, README and ChangeLog, and don't forget to add an entry
     ("Released x.y.z") to ChangeLog, so people can see which changes
     were before and after a given release. Make sure that NEWS has the
     correct version number!
  4) Update doc/*/Terminal.xml. Also update the figures in doc/*/images
     if the UI has changed.
  5) Run make update-po in po/ and update po/de.po (don't forget the header)!
  6) Unset terminal_version_tag in configure.ac and reset it after the
     release is done.
  7) Verify that make dist works.
  8) "svn commit" the changes.
  9) Create a simple tag for the release,
       "svn copy https://os-cillation.de:8080/repos/terminal/trunk \
          https://os-cillation.de:8080/repos/terminal/tags/release-X.Y.Z"
     where X.Y.Z is the version number.
 10) upload the tarball to os-cillation ftp
 11) Run /etc/os-scripts/update-docs-from-svn.sh on os-cillation webserver.
 12) Update freshmeat entry.
 13) Add new version to bugzilla product at http://bugzilla.xfce.org (Brian)
 14) Update gnomefiles.org entry.
