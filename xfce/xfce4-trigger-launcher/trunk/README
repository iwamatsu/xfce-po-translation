This is a launcher with two states. Like a trigger.


You need to set a few commands in the options:
- a command used to check status

  This command is executed periodically.
  It's exit code is taken to mean:
    =0         enabled
    =255       unknown/broken
    otherwise  disabled

- a command used to enable

  This command is executed when you click on the launcher 
  and state was "disabled".

- a command used to disable

  This command is executed when you click on the launcher 
  and state was "enabled".

- a command used to "wake up"/poke

  This command is executed when you click on the launcher 
  and state was "dodgy". Dodgy is when the "check status" 
  command returned "unknown" for too long/didn't return at all.

- check interval
- icon for state "enabled"
- icon for state "disabled"
- icon for state "unknown"
- icon for state "dodgy"

  Overtime is when the "check status" command returned "unknown" 
  for too long or didn't return at all.
