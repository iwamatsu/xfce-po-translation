= Xfce Appfinder =

This is a complete rewrite from Januari 2008 using the facilities provided by
libxfce4menu. The code is not based on an earlier version with the same name.

New in this version is the possibility to pass a specific menu file to
xfce4-appfinder, e.g. 'xfce4-appfinder /etc/xdg/menus/gnomecc.menu'.

= Development =

Help and patches are always welcome. For the coding style I have chosen the
GNU coding style with a line width of 100 instead of 80, and spaces for
indentation.

Your code should not changed when run through the following indent command:

  indent -npro -gnu -l100 -nut
