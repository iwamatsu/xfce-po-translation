4.4.0
=====

- Use screen from xevent instead of client for keypress (Bug #2749)
- Raise/focus when using alt+left-click for resize for consistency with move
- Be more permissive toward stick/unstick (bug #2735)

  between windows that have a transient relationship.
- Rework grab release (bug #2694)
- Fix display of ARGB32 windows with compositing enabled but without 
  compositor active (bug #2710).
- Apply NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION changes (otherwise it breaks xfwm4 
  demand attention mechanism), but do not obey client state change requests 
  for NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION if the client is already focused.
- Apply patch from Mike Massonnet that fixes an error in Stonage decoration 
  theme (Bug #2696)
- Do not apply NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION if client is already focused, as
  some apps seem to request NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION state even while
  focused (See comment #14 in bug #2678)
- Set the demands attention flag with focus prevention enabled only (Bug #2678)
- Update the NET_WM_STATE when the client requests an update of
  NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION (Bug #2678)

  when focus is transfered to a window that doesn't have InputHint set but 
  still use WM_PROTOCOLS_TAKE_FOCUS (ie, there is no way for the window 
  manager to tell whether or not the client will accept focus in the end 
  since focus is set by the client alone through the 'take focus' mechanism)
  (Fix bug #1853 without breaking bug #2410)
- Fix redraw problem with compositor
- Update application icon asynchronously to avoid queuing useless icon updates
  (Ubuntu/Launchpad bug #61424)
- Fix user focus timetamp being falsely reset to 0 causing some windows to be
  started un-focused (Bug #2664), re-add some traces (which compile with 
  -Werror this time), small code/api cleanup.
- Remove shadow on dock-type windows (bug #2648)
- Prevent fullscreen windows from beeing maximized (Bug #2663).
- Use timestamp provided by NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW and NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP messages 
  from EWMH version 1.3 and above, fix focus transition with 
  NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP messages causing either flickering or wrong restacking 
  on workspace switch (bug #2654),
- Quit nicely when MANAGE client message is received, so that xfwm4 obeys to 
  ICCCM2 standard (bug #2374)
- Fix demands attention being activated when it shouldn't
- Improve focus stealing prevention.
- Auto-maximize regular windows only.
- Be a lot more paranoid about what broken apps set as struts.
- Plug a huge X resources leak in handleMappingNotify () (bug #2618)
- Do not prevent stick when skip taskbar is set
- Re-enable focus passing to previously focused window (req. on ML)
- Focus windows that raise themselves if focus stealing prevention is 
  disabled, and set demands attention flag otherwise, that should improve 
  focus prevention.
- Keep focus on sticky windows only for regular windows w/out skip 
  taskbar/pager property (Bug 2603)
- Improve resize (Bug #2597)
- Be more permissive with resizes towards struts (Bug #2597, bis), optimize 
  shape use.
- Fix off-by-one causing windows to be moved wrongly via keyboard 
  (patch from Darren Salt (bug #2594)

  (Bug #2561)
- Hide as more windows when showing desktop (Bug #2518)
- Don't skip windows that have the skip pager/taskbar properties when 
  searching for windows below the pointer (bug #2550)
- Fix focus transitionning to root taking into account the pending focus too, 
  so that focus doesn't return to the fallback internal window when it should 
  return to some other client window (like when an application closes with a 
  modal dialog opened).
- Check for valid transient or modal when switching workspaces, to avoid 
  missing windows to unmap (bug #2518).
- Use X server time to restore focus when sent to the root window (bug #2472)
