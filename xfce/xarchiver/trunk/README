What is it?
===========
Xarchiver is the best user graphic interface on Linux for handling archives.
It's a Desktop Environment independent archiver frontend. All common archive
types are supported. RPM and DEB packages are handled without their package
managers. To run it you only need GTK+2 libraries and obviously the various
rar, arj and 7z for these archive types. All the others archivers are
installed by default in most distro.

How to use it:
=============
Please read the documentation accessible from the Help menu.

How to compile:
===============
./configure --prefix=/usr
make

become root with command su
make install
