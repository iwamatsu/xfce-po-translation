20080718: differences between 4.6 and 4.4 Version or Orage
---------
        * Man page created for orage and globaltime
        * Globaltime added.
            - shows several clocks from different timezones
            - can be raised and hidden by clicking middle mouse
              button on orage clock panel plugin
            - has timetune feature, which makes it easy to see what
              the time is in other clocks on certain time
        * All visible dates are now in country native format (strftime (%x))
        * All parameters now visible in preferences 
            - restructured parameter screens
        * New appointment types: TODO and JOURNAL
            - TODO can be used to remember things that needs to done
            - JOURNALs are for notes and things to remember
        * Possible to rename Orage calendar files
        * External files can be used
            - it is possible to add files from other sources
              and Orage keeps track on those.
        * Export and import appointments.
        * Text search in event list
        * Orage is now dependent on local libical.
            - standard libical cannot be used due to several fixes
              done to Orage's private copy
        * Daylist view
            - possible to see calendar in day view format in addition 
              to the old list view.
        * New alarms.
            - libnotify alarms
            - script type alarms
        * Possibility to set alarm based on end time also
        * Possible to define default alarm
        * Persistent alarms
            - persistent alarms are raised after Orage is started
              even if your computer or Orage has been turned off when the 
              alarm happened.
        * Orage and orageclock now only wake up when needed.
            - saves battery in laptops when timer wakes up only when
              needed instead of regularly every second.
        * Main calendar now has list of events and todos.
        * Better compatibility with evolution ical files
        * Categories added
            - also possible to give colour to certain category
              and then colour is shown in even list view
