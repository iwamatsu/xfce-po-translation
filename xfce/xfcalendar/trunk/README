Time-managing application for the Xfce desktop environment.

Orage 4.3 uses new ical interface instead of old dbh to store and
utilize calender appointments. 

libical-0.24RC4 version is needed and it comes together with Orage
package.  It contains several fixes so you must use this version instead
of any base libical version.

Note that there is no conversion routine to migrate your old data into 
the new format, but you will loose all old appointments and start from
clean table.

First thing you want to do is add your local timezone in the preferces,
If you do not set local timezone, do not use timezones in any appointments
either. It will cause just problems.
