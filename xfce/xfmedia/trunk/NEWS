Version 0.9.2 (27 Nov 2006):
  Bugfixes:
    * Fix finding the global keybindings file when XDG_DATA_DIRS isn't set
      up properly (bug 1152).
    * Fix some duplicate keyboard mnemonics in the prefs window (bug 1197).
    * Fix non-UTF-8 filenames breaking xfmedia-remote (bug 1191)
    * Fix fullscreen control window positioning.
    * Fix xine UI message event handling (or at least make it work better).
    * Fix autosave handling (bug 1722, sorta).
    * Fix symbol export and crash in infopipe plugin (bug 2524).
    * Update Gtk icon cache when icons are installed.
    * Fix window size changes between tracks when playing consecutive video
      files in the playlist.
    * Fix D-Bus compilation again.
    * Properly detect the presence of TagLib on systems that break the C
      bindings out into a separate package.

  Features:
    * Remember last opened directory in file chooser.
    * Remember playlist queue position.
    * Implement better screensaver-disabling algorithm using the XSCREENSAVER
      extension to query X's idle time.
    * Add back xine_plugins_garbage_collector() for versions of xine-lib that
      do not cause crashes.  This should decrease memory usage.
    * Assume files that end in '.iso' are DVD images.
    * Display files that are longer than an hour as HH:MM:SS rather than
      MM:SS in the playlist (bug 2370, patch from Erik Harrison).
    * Support the icon naming spec for some more icons.
    * New/Updated translations: a bunch; sorry, I lost track!


  Known Issues:
    * If a network connection fails, the infobar may be left in an incorrect
      state.
    * Using drag-and-drop to reorder playlist items is semi-broken (for now,
      drag the row out of the playlist to get it to recognise the drag)
      (bug 1041).
    * Files with the '#' character in them aren't loaded properly (bug 1929).
    * Streaming audio does not work in many situations (bug 2424).


Version 0.9.1 (14 Sep 2005):
  Bugfixes:
    * Fix crash on startup with gtk 2.8.x.

  Known Issues:
    * If a network connection fails, the infobar may be left in an incorrect
      state.


Version 0.9.0 (10 Sep 2005):
  Bugfixes:
    * Support the MRL_REFERENCE signal from libxine so downloaded ASX playlists
      that libxine handles will work properly (bug 1079).
    * Fix --verbose and --debug options.
    * Fix volume slider clicking behavior.
    * Disable the use of xine_plugins_garbage_collector(), as it can cause
      crashes sometimes if settings are changed.
    * Make autohide behave a little better.

  Features:
    * Added handled MIME types to the .desktop file.
    * Added -t/--toggle option to xfmedia-remote, which toggles the play/pause
      state of the player (bug 1021).
    * Added -j/-jump-to-file option to xfmedia-remote, which shows and focuses
      the Xfmedia window, and shows the jump to file entry box (bug 1020).
    * Add some sorting options to the add directory dialog (bug 507):
      - Sort by filename (old behavior)
      - Sort by title
      - Sort by artist, title
      - Sort by artist, album, track number
    * Add option to perform action (play/pause, next, prev) on middle click of
      tray icon (bug 1087).
    * Add the ability to edit file metadata tags.  This feature requires
      TagLib (http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html) (bug 980).
    * Use xine_plugins_garbage_collector() where supported (xine-lib >= 1.0.1)
      to reduce memory footprint.
    * Add -c/--clear-playlist option to xfmedia to start xfmedia without
      loading the default playlist.
    * Devices preferences panel to set CD/DVD/VCD devices, audio/video devices,
      and speaker arrangement.
    * Add methods to the D-BUS interface to get the playlist, a specific
      playlist entry, and the currently-playing entry (thanks: Pasi Orovuo).
    * Add a playlist queue.  Enqueue playlist items by right-clicking a playlist
      entry, and selecting 'Enqueue'.  See the playlist queue by right-clicking
      in the main window and selecting 'Playlist Queue...'.
    * Add --vwin-geometry to set a static size/position for the video window.
      Useful for, e.g., playing on a TV where there's too much overscan.
    * New/Updated translations:
      - Spanish (Jaime Buffery)
      - Hungarian (Atilla Szervac)
      - Chinese (Simplified) (Sheng Feng Zhou)
      - Gujarati (Ankit Patel)
      - French (Stephane Roy)
      - Basque (Piarres Beobide)
      - Finnish (Jari Rahkonen)

  Known Issues:
    * If a network connection fails, the infobar may be left in an incorrect
      state.


Version 0.8.0 (12 Jun 2005):
  Bugfixes:
    * Fix crash if D-BUS session bus isn't running (bug 845).
    * When specifying both --enqueue and --autoplay on the commandline,
      start playing the correct entry, not the first entry (bug 839).
    * The video window now won't steal focus when in full screen on a single
      Xinerama monitor (bug 860).
    * Fix video window aspect ratio on stream change.  Previously it was
      keeping the aspect ratio of the last video played.
    * Fix state where main window disappears if "minimise to tray" is selected
      and the user switches workspaces (bug 883).
    * When recursively adding directories, only add files if their extensions
      are in xine's supported extensions list.
  
  Features:
    * Show stream title in window manager titlebar (bug 884).
    * Add keybindings for zoom in/out.
    * Add keybindings for window larger/smaller.
    * Add volume button in main window (bug 877).
    * Add keybinding for setting volume (bug 877).
    * Recursively add files if a directory is dropped on the playlist (e.g.,
      from a file manager) (bug 919).
    * Handle set-title events from xine (e.g. DVD titles).
    * Handle format-changed events from xine so the window resizes an
      re-aspects if the video frame size changes.
    * Integrate the jump to file window with the main window (bug 775).
    * New xfmedia-remote binary for controlling an instance of Xfmedia from
      the command line.  See 'xfmedia-remote --help' for usage.
    * New/Updated translations:
      - French (Stephane Roy)
      - Basque (Piarres Beobide)
      - Finnish (Jari Rahkonen)
      - Vietnamese (Phan Vinh Thinh)

  Known Issues:
    * If a network connection fails, the infobar may be left in an incorrect
      state.
    * The volume button in the main window is a little odd.  If you click
      the volume button to clear away the slider when it's visible, it
      reappears again.  I need to reimplement it as a menu-like widget.


Version 0.7.1 (18 Mar 2005):
  Bugfixes:
    * Fix compile failure if D-BUS is not available (Adam Sampson) (bug 841).
    * Fix installation of documentation.
    * Update Finnish translation (Jari Rahkonen)

  Known Issues:
    * Autoplay items can't get stream title info for now, but they appear to
      play OK.
    * If a network connection fails, the infobar may be left in an incorrect
      state.


Version 0.7.0 (17 Mar 2005):

  Bugfixes:
    * Fix problem where renaming a folder in the mediamarks manager would
      turn it into a normal mediamark item (bug 632).
    * Fix video window visibility when playing from a mediamark (bug 630).
    * Fix situation where mediamark->stop->play will play a the currently-
      selected playlist track, not the selected mediamark (bug 636).
    * Fix a possible crash when a mediamark finishes playing when on shuffle
      play.
    * Don't pass key presses in the treeview to the keybindings system if
      we're using gtk 2.6 or above, since 2.6 has a type-ahead find feature
      in GtkTreeView.
    * Don't allow editing the root mediamark node.
    * Select the item under the mouse in the mediamarks editor on right
      click, before showing the menu.
    * Make the remote interface more flexible and better at reporting
      errors.
    * Autoplay along with --enqueue works properly now, and --enqueue will
      attempt to launch an instance of xfmedia if one is not found.
    * Use the thousands separator appropriate to the current locale (bug 655).
    * If autohide is activated after the video window goes to fullscreen,
      make sure the autohide window doesn't appear on top of the fullscreen
      window.
    * Make sure xine doesn't pause the currently-playing stream if it takes a
      while to open a networked stream to get file info (bug 654).
    * Recreate the tray icon if the systray goes away and reappears (bug 668).
    * Fix shuffle memory not getting updated properly when adding a directory
      recursively (bug 688).
    * Huge amount of refactoring to make the codebase more maintainable.
    * Fix problem where using the keybindings to seek backward past the
      beginning of a stream would cause strange large negative numbers to
      appear in the display (bug 742).
    * Fix some gtk assertion-related crashes that I think have to do with the
      infopipe plugin (bug 640).
    * Fix metadata load when adding a playlist entry to the visible area (bug
      765).
    * Fix DnD to an empty playlist (bug 773).

  Features:
    * Added parser for .asx playlists (bug 633).
    * Added an infobar that replaces the song label and displays progress
      messages and other UI messages when needed (bug 634).
    * When holding down and moving the position slider, show the time that
      it will seek to if the slider is released.
    * Add friendly names for keybindings in the editor.
    * Status tooltip for tray icon.
    * Sort by title or filename, and randomise.
    * Rewrite remote control interface to use D-BUS.
    * New translations:
      - Basque (pi)
      - German (Bernhard Walle)
      - Finnish (Jari Rahkonen)
      - French (Stephane Roy)
      - Lithuanian (Rimas Kudelis)
      - Polish (Robert Kurowski)
      - Brasilian Portuguese (Tomas Schertel)
      - Slovak (Juraj Brosz)
    * Transient dialogs (file chooser, URL entry dialog) no longer block the
      rest of the GUI.

  Known Issues:
    * Autoplay items can't get stream title info for now, but they appear to
      play OK.
    * If a network connection fails, the infobar may be left in an incorrect
      state.


Version 0.6.0 (29 Dec 2004):

  Bugfixes:
    * Translatable strings update.
    * Check to make sure xine returns a nonempty string for metadata; avoids
      blank titles in the playlist.
    * Restore video window position when going from fullscreen to windowed.
    * When adding files via directory recursion, sort them alphabetically.
    * When displaying file names in the playlist (format %f), only display
      the file name, not the full path.
    * Playlist titles ellipsize properly (thanks to Benny).
    * Fix occasional crash on File Info dialog.
    * Eat up/down arrow events while focus is on the playlist so we don't
      activate keybindings for playlist navigation.
    * Make the directory recurse dialog work better: clicking "open" should
      now actually select the current directory, not open another one.  Thanks
      to Harring Figueiredo on gtk-app-devel-list for figuring this one out.
    * Shuffle should avoid playing the same track twice, at least not for
      a very very very very long time.
    * Fix keybindings when numlock is active.
    * Use the stock icon system for the playback controls rather than themed
      icons.

  Features:
    * Documentation added for the plugin system.
    * Add option to load metadata a) on playlist scroll, b) on file play,
      or c) never.
    * When playlist is focused, delete key will remove the selected entries,
      and enter/return will play the selected entry.
    * Add 'repeat single track' option, because every now and then I feel
      like obsessively listening to a single song 35 times.
    * Make tray icon themable.
    * Make playback control icons themable.
    * Add xfmedia-plugin.pc for third-party plugin compilation.
    * Add mediamarks support with an editor.
    * Jump-to-file window remembers its last position and size.

  Known Issues:
    * Autoplay items can't get stream title info for now, but they appear to
      play OK.


Version 0.5.0 (25 Nov 2004):

  Bugfixes:
    * Fullscreen should work properly on Xinerama-enabled setups now (untested).
    * Don't mess with window focus when showing the autohide window.
    * If autohide is active and the user clicks the tray icon, hide the
      autohide window (previously it would show the main window, and leave
      the autohide window up as well).
    * There shouldn't be any more Pango UTF-8 errors printed to console.
    * Handle .pls files properly, both loading and saving.
    * Rewrite the playlist load/save code to be a bit less icky.

  Features:
    * Ability to change aspect ratio (via keybinding).
    * Ability to mute audio (via keybinding).
    * "Jump to File" box with filtered treeview (gtk 2.4+ only).
    * Now we close the video driver when only audio is playing.  This way,
      other apps will be able to use it (in the case of the Xv driver, at
      least).
    * Preliminary plugin system.
    * First simple plugin - "infopipe" - that can print out stream data by
      catting a pipe in /tmp.
    * Added a preliminary unix-socket-based remote control interface.  See
      README.remote for details.
    * Add some command line options, including --enqueue, --fullscreen,
      and --autoplay.
    * Keybindings editor is now fully functional.
    * Overlay user's keybinding file with the system keybinding file.
    * Adding a playlist file from the "Add File" dialog will add the files
      to the current playlist.

  Known Issues:
    * Sometimes crashes when selecting "File Info" from the right-click
      menu.  Seems to happen more often with video files.
    * Autoplay items can't get stream title info for now, but they appear to
      play OK.
    * I'm not calculating the inner width of the treeview cells properly (or
      something), because sometimes the entry names don't ellipsize correctly.
      At least the window doesn't resize on its own anymore.


Version 0.4.0.1 (10 Nov 2004):

  Bugfixes:
    * Fix build for GTK+ 2.2.

  Known Issues:
    (same as 0.4.0)


Version 0.4.0 (10 Nov 2004):

  Bugfixes:
    * Close fullscreen window at end of stream if it's not needed anymore.
    * Sticky state of window should be preserved if the window is hidden
      and then later shown again.
    * Autohide behaves a little better; before it wasn't hiding if you
      moved the mouse fast enough such that it missed the event of leaving
      via the window decorations.
    * Fixed play/pause icon setting on creation of tray icon's menu.  Also
      make the tray icon's menu item say "Play" or "Pause" appropriately,
      not just "Play/Pause" all the time.
    * Fix autohide window resize problem.
    * Fix condition where video window wouldn't be shown if the stream
      ended and the user clicked play again to re-view the stream (bug 433).
    * Hide video window and/or fullscreen window when the user clicks stop.
    * Autohide dock now watches the window decorations as well so it can
      hide the window properly, and checks for menu activation and
      deactivation, as well as the presence of a file open/save dialog, so it
      doesn't hide while a popup menu or dialog is open.
    * Window now remembers it's always-on-top state after being minimised
      to the tray icon.
    * If there's an invalid file at the end of the list, and repeat is
      enabled, and the user double-clicks on the file, it will now jump back
      to the top of the list as it should.
    * Set video window aspect ratio after playback starts so we definitely
      know the frame size.
    * Fix start from session manager; don't add arguments starting with '-'
      to the playlist.
    * Fix repeat play on an empty playlist (bug 470).
    * If playlists have relative paths, take them as relative to the playlist's
      directory, not the current working directory.
    * Only reset the screen saver if we're in fullscreen video mode.  This
      will fix the problem where it appears that X forgot that you were
      holding down the shift key if you're typing and you hold it down for a
      while.
    * Fix another possible deadlock on close.
    * Hacked together an ellipsized text cell renderer for GtkTreeView so the
      playlist window doesn't resize on its own anymore.

  Features:
    * Add menu positioning function for "Add Playlist Item" button to place
      the menu such that the pointer is in the bottom left of the menu.
    * Session management support.
    * Xfmedia closes xine's audio output if nothing is currently playing.
      This will help on systems where the audio driver only allows a single
      app to have the device open.
    * Ability to add xine autoplay items to the playlist (e.g., DVD, CD).
    * Autohide has a 500 ms timeout before it actually hides, and cancels
      the action if you reenter the window before the time is up.
    * Some basic keybindings support, with a read-only (for now) editor.
    * Implement some fine-tuned stream navigation via keybindings, as well
      as A/V sync adjust and changing playback speed.
    * Use themed icons for repeat/shuffle if available.
    * Ability to add playlist items via DnD from external apps.

  Known Issues:
    * Sometimes crashes when selecting "File Info" from the right-click
      menu.  Seems to happen more often with video files.
    * Autoplay items can't get stream title info for now, but they appear to
      play OK.
    * I'm not calculating the inner width of the treeview cells properly (or
      something), because sometimes the entry names don't ellipsize correctly.
      At least the window doesn't resize on its own anymore.


Version 0.3.0 (31 Oct 2004):

  Bugfixes:
    * Crashes and hangs on close (especially on *BSD) should be fixed now.
    * Reordering playlist items via DnD will no longer mess up the index
      order playlist column.
    * Dnd to move a playlist item to the #1 position should work now
      (workaround of a Gtk+ bug/oddity).
    * Some internal GtkXine reorganisation to make things cleaner.
    * Song title label ellipsises, and shouldn't make the window grow
      anymore.
    * Shouldn't deadlock after stream end or switching between audio-only
      and audio/video streams anymore.
    * Adding a directory might sorta work now.  For Gtk+ 2.4, you have to
      click the current directory on the buttons on the top and then click
      Open on the bottom.
    * Recursive directory adds don't lock up the GUI.
    * There are probably more that I've forgotten.

  Features:
    * Selectable audio visualisation, depending on what your libxine supports.
    * Control window/playlist is dockable to screen edges, and can autohide
      (this is kinda finicky; not really happy with it yet).
    * Xfmedia tries to be more intelligent about when it should and shouldn't
      save the playlist at exit time.
    * Collapsed control window takes up less room (it's shorter).
    * There are probably more that I've forgotten.

  Known Issues:
    * Sometimes crashes when selecting "File Info" from the right-click
      menu.  Seems to happen more often with video files.
    * A long song title in the playlist itself can still make the window
      grow horizontally.


Version 0.2.0
    * Um, I forgot to do a NEWS entry.  Sorry.


Version 0.1.0 (25 Oct 2004):

  Bugfixes:
    * None, since this is the intial release ^_~.

  Features:
    * Supports video and audio playback using the xine engine.
    * GTK+ GUI has a simple control interface with a collapsable,
      attached playlist.
    * Fullscreen video mode (toggle by double-clicking the video window),
      with embedded playback controls (activated when the mouse moves to the
      bottom of the screen).
    * Drag-and-drop to rearrange playlist items.
    * Startup notification support.
    * View time elapsed or time remaining (single click the time display
      to toggle).
    * File metadata view (audio only so far).
    * Playback support for local files as well as network streaming via
      http, rtsp, mms, etc. (basically anything xine supports).
    * Playback for any video/audio formats that xine supports.  Note: some
      formats have other dependencies that must be met when libxine is
      compiled.  See the libxine documentation for details.
    * Ability to format titles in the playlist according to a
      user-configurable string based on file metadata.
    * Ability to show the Xfmedia window on all workspaces and/or in
      always-on-top mode.

  Known Issues:
    * Sometimes crashes when selecting "File Info" from the right-click
      menu.  Seems to happen more often with video files.
    * Sometimes deadlocks after double-clicking a different playlist entry.
    * Sometimes deadlocks after stream end.
    * Adding a directory to the playlist doesn't work right (I think I'm
      doing something wrong with respect to the file chooser widget).
    * Playlist can cause the window to resize horizontally.
    * A long song name can cause the window to resize horizontally.
