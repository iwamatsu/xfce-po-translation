Xfmedia is a lightweight media player GUI using GTK+, based on the xine engine,
using the core Xfce 4 libraries.  It is written by Brian Tarricone and
released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2.

Please see the NEWS file for information about what's new in this Xfmedia
release.  Please report all bugs to http://bugzilla.xfce.org/.


** Retrieving **

The latest version of Xfmedia can always be obtained from
http://spuriousinterrupt.org/projects/xfmedia/.  Please check to see if there
is a newer version available before reporting bugs.


** Requirements **

Xfmedia is based on libxine, a media player framework library.  Xfmedia was
originally developed against a release candidate of libxine 1.0.0.  Earlier
versions of libxine may work, but are unsupported.  Libxine should be
available via your distro's packaging system; be sure to install the related
-dev or -devel package if required on your distro.  Otherwise, libxine can be
obtained from http://xine.sourceforge.net/.

GTK+ version 2.4.0 or greater is required.  GTK+ can be obtained from
http://gtk.org/.

Xfmedia uses Xfce 4's core utility and GUI libraries, libxfce4util and
libxfcegui4.  It requires version 4.1.90 (Xfce 4.2-beta1) or newer.  Xfce's
core libraries can be obtained from http://xfce.org/.

Optionally, Xfmedia can be controlled remotely when built with D-BUS support.
D-BUS versions 0.2x and 0.3x are supported.  D-BUS can be obtained from
http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fdbus.

For metadata tag editing (VorbisComment, ID3, etc.), TagLib is required.
TagLib can be obtained from http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html.


** Building **

Just the usual:

./configure
make
make install

If 'configure' fails, read its output and correct any errors on your system
before proceeding.  There are a few configure options


** Usage **

The GUI frontend can be started by running 'xfmedia'.  If compiled with D-BUS
support, the GUI can be controlled using the 'xfmedia-remote' command.  See
the --help option for details.
